| source.excerpts.1.value | Nor is the contami - nation confined to his own dwelling .In order to purify himself before he offers his daily prayers in the mosque , he visits an outer yard devoted to this purpose , and then washes himself in an adjacent tank of putrid water .The contents of these yards , where fifty or a hundred Mus - sulmen may be seen at a time , flow into an uncovered canal , which generally terminates in a large ditch in a public square near the habitations . |

| source.excerpts.2.value | The bilge - water alone cannot be pumped out ; there must be means , under control , of ad - mitting fresh water to dilute it , and the whole may then be removed by means of the pump at daily intervals ; that is , each day the foul water should be diluted , and a portion of it carried out by means of the pump ; and if this system were continued with regularity , the bilge water would be retained as sweet and pure as the external water in which the vessel floats .At present , vessels with foul bilges can only be considered , as just stated , as floating cesspools of the most dangerous kind ; be - cause the motion of the vessel keeps the fetid water in constant agitation , and the whole atmosphere between decks is tainted with the vapour and gases given off .There can be little doubt but that most of the nausea and sickness experienced by lands - men on first being confined to a sea - going vessel arises from the vitiated atmosphere consequent upon foul bilge - water . |

| source.excerpts.4.value | Dr .Mead , a century and a half ago , in assigning the reason why Cairo is the birthplace and cradle of the plague , says , â   " Cairo is crowded vrith vast numbers of inhabitants , who live iDoorly and nastily ; the streets are narrow and close ; the heat is stifling ; a great canal passes through the city , which at the overflowing of the Nile is filled with water ; on the decrease of the river this canal is gradually dried up , and the people throw into it all manner of filth , carrion , and offal ; the stench which arises from this and the mud together is intolerably offensive , and from this source the plague , constantly springing up every year , preys upon the inhabitants , and is stopped only by the return of the Nile , the overflowing of which washes away this load of filth .In Ethiopia the swarms of locusts are so prodigious that they sometimes cause a liunine by devouring the fruits of the earth , and when they die create a pestilence by the putrefaction of their bodies . |

| source.excerpts.12.value | The supply of water , hardly enough for cooking and drinking , does not allow washing .In many ships the filthy beds , teeming with all abominations , are never required to be brought on deck and aired ; the narrow space between the sleeping - berths and the piles of boxes is never washed or scraped , but breathes up a damp and fetid stench , until the day before arrival at quarantine , when all hands are required to ' scrub up , ' and put on a fair face for the doctor and Government Inspector ." No moral restraint is attempted ; the voice of prayer is never heard . |

| source.excerpts.13.value | Having experienced some sickness at sea from bilge - water , and tried remedies to get rid of the nuisance , which renders vessels not merely ill - drained and moveable cellar dwellings , as they have been properly designated by the Board , but moveable cesspools constantly in motion , I beg to state that , during the time I was engineer to the Bridgewater Trust , the following - plan was adopted : â   a small pump was fitted up and attached to the engine , which could be connected for work at pleasure : this pump passed into a Avell formed betwixt the timbers , into which a communication was made fore and aft .A pipe and tap was fixed in the side of the vessel slightly under the water - line , so as to admit at pleasure a supply of fresh sea - water to the bilge ; and this was done daily to the extent of effectually diluting any foul water that might have accumulated , and the whole was then pumped out by the engine : by this means the vessels were kept perfectly free from the foul and sickening smell so common in all vessels where bilge - water is allowed to accumulate .This plan may be adopted in every form of vessel , substitut - ing hand - labour at the pump for the engine in the steamer ; and even in the steamer the pump must be arranged so as to be occasionally worked by hand ; for instance , at such times as the engine is not in use , when the boat is in dock , taking in cargo , & c . |
