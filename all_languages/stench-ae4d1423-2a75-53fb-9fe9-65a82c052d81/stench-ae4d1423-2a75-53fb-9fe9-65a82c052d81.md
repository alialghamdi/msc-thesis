| source.excerpts.0.value | As the man was directly behind my back , I could not observe whether these extraordinary communications by signal were replied * to by him ; but rather suppose they were not ; as it is contrary to the etiquette of this polite court to retaliate any of the Princeâ   s jokes at the Durbar , especially in the presence of foreign Ambassadors .The stench arising from the numerous carcasses , which Jay strewed about the Bazar , was almost intolerable ; it is hardly credible , that any people should prefer submitting to such a nuisance , to the little trouble of removing it from their immediate neighbourhood .Continual bickerings and disputes have lately taken place 1 68 LETTERS FROM A MAHRATTA CAMP . |

| source.excerpts.1.value | Our station is in the rear of the whole ; and we generally contrive to keep at the distance of about a mile from the army ; their disgusting want of cleanliness render - ing them most disagreeable neighbours .It is impossible to take a ride in the vicinity of the great camp , without being poisoned by the stench arising from the carcases of horses , bullocks and camels , which no one takes the trouble to remove , and a variety of other nuisances ; besides being in - terrupted by the crowds of people and cattle that go out every morning to forage , and return again in the evening .One of the most noted corps in the Muha Raj ' s army is a Risalu , or troop , called the Baruh B , haees , or twelve brothers ; from that number of leaders which originally headed them . |

| source.excerpts.2.value | Even these scenes of mirth and jollity are enacted in such tents as have already been described , and are exhibited to the eye through the medium only of half a dozen wicks immersed in thick gross oil , arranged in a dirty brass cruise , and which together scarcely afford as much light as a common English rushlight .The liquor sold in the shops is distilled from the fruit of a tree called Mouali : it is about as strong as common gin , and is impregnated Avith a smell and flavour that Avould turn the stomach of the stoutest porter in London .In this state it is termed Soopoor . |
