The whole ofthe evidence , however , appears to lead to the con - clusion that it is the combination of impurity with humidity of the air which so powerfully predisposes to cholera ; cleanliness being apparently capable of counteracting the influence of mere hu - midity : thus the remarkable exemption enjoyed by Holland from the visitation of cholera , is generally and probably correctly attributed to the scrupulous cleanliness of the houses and habits of the people . |

Traps are put to the street gullies next the foot pavement , winch prevent the foul air from rising from the sewer , but which nine times out of ten create as much of it themselves , and then another openin - is made a few feet further ofi ' in the middle of the street to venlilate the sevver , and discharge the foul air that the neighbouring trap is con - structed to prevent !

In this same locality occurred the next cases of cholera , one of the sufferers stating that he had got up early one morning and gone on deck ; that the smell from the bone vessels lying a - head was so bad that it made him feel sick , and that he had never been well since ." The condition of the houses of the labouring population in this district , through which cholera spread with great rapidity , was , " continues this witness , " extremely bad . |

| source.excerpts.109.value | Foul matter collects in the angles , where the water has no power over it , exactly as in the flat - bottomed sewer , rhese traps are frequently the chief cause of the nuisance they are intended to prevent .I recently met with a case in which a great leno - th of sewer was supposed to be so foul that , notwithstanding all the gullv holes were trapped , it created the most abominable odours .On ex - ammation , however , I found the sewer perfectly clear of deposit and free from smell , but every trap in connexion with it was filled with de - composing matter that poisoned the whole neighbourhood . |

| source.excerpts.112.value | Running water is the cheapest , best , and most effectual means for conveying away the filth and refuse of a town .It is stated as a matter of practical experience , that from sewers which are full , or nearly full of vvater ^ and have no surfaces of solid or semi - fluid refuse exposed , there is comparatively little smell ; and that when sewers are flushed , or when they are partly full and have a tolerably good run of water , the friction of the stream of water carries with it a current of air , proportionate to the rapidity of the run ; sometimes in considerable volume .The observations made warrant the expectation that , by attention to this principle in the construction and arrangement of the smaller - sized sewers , much of the gaseous emanations may be removed , and in some cases the sewers made to create a down draft of air from the house - drains . |
