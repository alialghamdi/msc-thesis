| source.excerpts.6.value | Having experienced some sickness at sea from bilge - water , and tried remedies to get rid of the nuisance , which renders vessels not merely ill - drained and moveable cellar dwellings , as they have been properly designated by the Board , but moveable cesspools constantly in motion , I beg to state that , during the time I was engineer to the Bridgewater Trust , the following plan was adopted : â   a small pump was fitted up and attached to the engine , which could be connected for work at pleasure : this pump passed into a well formed betwixt the timbers , into which a communication was made fore and aft .A pipe and tap was fixed in the side of the vessel slightly under the waterÂ ¬ line , so as to admit at pleasure a supply of fresh sea - water to the bilge ; and this was done daily to the extent of effectually diluting any foul water that might have accumulated , and the whole was then pumped out by the engine : by this means the vessels were kept perfectly free from the foul and sickening smell so common in all vessels where bilge - water is allowed to accumulate .This plan may be adopted in every form of vessel , substituting hand - labour at the pump for the engine in the steamer ; and even in the steamer the pump must be arranged so as to be occasionally worked by hand ; for instance , at such times as the engine is not in use , when the boat is in dock , taking in cargo , & c . |

| source.excerpts.9.value | As the Delta is a plain of an uniform leyel , in order to construct their habitations , the peasants are obliged to dig excavations , which they do in the immediate vicinity of their future residence .The pits thus formed are filled with water at each inundation of the Nile , which remains stagnant during the remainder of the year ; millions of insects give life to them , and they soon become as repulsive to the smell as to the sight .Yet it is from these sinks of corruption that the peasants draw the water which they drink and use , and in them that they perform the daily ablutions enjoined by their religion . |

| source.excerpts.10.value | Dr .Mead , a century and a half ago , in assigning the reason why Cairo is the birthplace and cradle of the plague , says , â   â   Cairo is crowded with vast numbers of inhabitants , who live poorly and nastily ; the streets are narrow and close ; the heat is stifling ; a great canal passes through the city , which at the overflowing of the Nile is filled with water ; on the decrease of the river this canal is gradually dried up , and the people throw into it all manner of filth , carrion , and offal ; the stench which arises from this and the mud together is intolerably offensive , and from this source the plague , constantly springing up every year , preys upon the inhabitants , and is stopped only by the return of the Nile , the overflowing of which washes away this load of filth .In Ethiopia the swarms of locusts are so prodigious that they sometimes cause a famine by devouring the fruits of the earth , and when they die create a pestilence by the putrefaction of their bodies . |
