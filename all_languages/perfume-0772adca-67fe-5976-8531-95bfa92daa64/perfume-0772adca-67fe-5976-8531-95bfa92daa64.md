| source.excerpts.21.value | Weather changes depend upon a variety of local conditions , modified by external influences , and on the two main islands of the West Indies the aggregate of those factors is complex indeed .A number of densely wooded mountain ranges , varying from low hill chains to Alplike sierras , alternate with arid plains and reeking jungles , and air currents from the eight principal points of the compass are apt to cause as many different modifications of humidity and temperature .These imported meteorological tendencies have often to be taken into account to explain the curious weather freaks of special districts . |

| source.excerpts.29.value | I wonder if you ever reflected that our entire contact with the outer world , our entire knowledge of it , is in the last analysis dependent upon but one sense , the sense of touch , and that the sensory nerves , those telegraphic lines between our consciousness and the outer world , respond to but one operator , direct contact ? Yet this is strictly so .We see , because waves of light break upon the shores of vision ; we hear , because waves of sound strike against the ear drum ; we smell , because minute particles of the odoriferous substance , or perhaps because peculiar and as yet unnamed waves induced by such a substance , impinge against our noses ; we taste , because of the direct impact of food and drink against the sensitive nerve ends of the tongue .We have but one sense , a tactile sense , and if instead of manual training we should say tactile training , we should pretty nearly hit the mark . |

| source.excerpts.30.value | The chemist searching and seeking with tireless experiment for the art of tempering copper ; the economist spending time and intellect on the various monetary questions ; the advocate of equal rights for equal sexes ; the statesman studying trade policies and race problems ; and the sculptor striving by his colored statues to get nearer Nature ' s self , are but working out again the problems whose solution constitutes the treasures of little Athens , queen of reason , arts , and letters , and whose influence on the civilization of the future is as yet unsearchable .The ivory palaces , bright with gold , have indeed fallen to decay , but frankincense and myrrh still exhale their everlasting perfume amid the beauteous ruins .YOUNG GREEK BOYS AND OLD GREEK SCHOOLS . |
