| source.excerpts.1.value | This being settled satisfactorily , we returned to prepare for our departure .On this road from Damascus by Aleppo and to Nisibin , the bread has a peculiar unpleasant bitter taste , which I can only account for from the ovens being heated with wormwood ( Absinthe : Artemisii ) , with which these plains abound , and which forms their chief fuel ; the essential oil from this aromatic herb being volatilized penetrates the bread exposed to its action .March 28 . |

| source.excerpts.2.value | We halted for nearly two hours the last afternoon , to avoid arriving at Bagdad in the night or too early in the morning ; threw a line over for fish , but only succeeded in taking a small one , a specimen of a numerous family peculiar to the Asian rivers , and which all go by the name of Shabood , or Kaboodie : they have no scales , and a great many long beards from the nose and chin .I do not think I ever witnessed a more magnificent sunset than on this evening off El Howash : the river was literally a mass of molten gold ; a breeze winding through the taper shafts of the feathery palms wafted from the orange groves floods of the most exquisite exquisite perfume ; and the ruddy rays shot far away into the recesses of the interminable colonnades that lined the eastern shore , and bathed the weeping branches in crimson light : it was a scene of enchantment , which repaid one for much toil .We floated on under the wooded shore , watching the changing hues , and enjoy / ing the luxury of the hour , till night closed around , and threw a veil over its beauties ; to reveal the vast spangled concave reflected in the sleeping mirror , making our little raft seem like the centre of one immense blue starry sphere : we had several escapes of being dashed against the poles supporting supporting scaffoldings during the night ; and the boatman persuading us we were much nearer the town than was the fact , we brought up for four hours . |

| source.excerpts.3.value | On account of the near approach of the rainy season , sufficient vapours were accumulated to produce the most glorious sunsets , which heightened the beauty of the scenery , tinting the broad expanse and the mountain peaks with gold , purple and crimson .At this late season the trees were clothed with verdure , and the fragrant myrtles in full bloom , and growing in the wildest exuberance .Wandering amidst these scenes seemed like the realization of a poet ' s dream , and this , with delightful society , open - hearted kindness , and intel - SYRIA , 149 quinine in cases of intermittent fever ; it is a creeping plant of a dusty - white appearance , possessing a fine aromatic bitter , and has been used with great success . |

| source.excerpts.4.value | Following the course of this stream , or rather stagnant ditch , we started a large wild hog , with several young pigs : Mr .Ainsworth bagged one of these with shot , and we then loaded with ball and tried to get a shot at the old ones : the banks were intersected with holes and ravines , overgrown with long rank grass , affording them good cover ; alarmed by the shots , the pigs were seen making off in all directions for the Tigris : we gave chase to a party of five , but our horses being fatigued , we could only muster a canter : I was gaining fast , however , on two of them , which stopped every now and then , as if they intended to show fight , the reason of which I soon discovered by seeing they were followed by four little pigs , about three months old ; I pushed forward and cut off the retreat of these , as the old pigs , abandoning their young , had disappeared over a rising ground , being well ahead of the litter : I dismounted in the track made by the old ones in the long grass , and presently I heard all the young ones galloping up , squeaking and grunting in full cry , till they found me in their path , when they stopped , and began sniffing and examining ASIA MINOR .131 ful over the sunny deep . |

| source.excerpts.8.value | The common vulture and the black vulture are very numerous in Asia Minor and of enormous size ; at a distance , when gathered round a carcase , vultures have the appearance of a party of Arabs sitting on the plain ; they are very heavy in rising and are obliged to assist themselves with their feet , running along the ground till they get their immense vanes fairly expanded , when they soar away in concentric circles .There has been a controversy as to how the vulture discovers a carcase , and a vulgar error has been propagated , giving the bird the property of scent at miles distant .An observation of facts places the matter in a simple light . |

| source.excerpts.9.value | The embroidery , I was told , is the work of the ladies in the harems , and many of them are articles of wearing apparel , which they send to the shops to raise money on their own account : as ladies in England dispose of their jewels for the same purpose ! The confectioners ' shops have a very pretty appearance from the varied colour and form of the different sweetmeats tastefully arranged under glass cases .They are , however , more pleasing to the eye than gratifying gratifying to the taste , composed of sugar , scented with otto of rose and other strong essences .The saddlers ' bazaar was our object , where we purchased saddles , bridles , saddle PALESTINE . |

| source.excerpts.11.value | — The country from Fiume to Segn is extremely extremely barren : with the exception of orchards of apricot and fig - trees wherever the soil can afford them support .The road is bordered by bare white hills of rock , only relieved by the soft foliage of the fragrant wild sage which springs from every crevice .The broken nature of the coast , forming chains of lagoons , bounded by large rocky islands , which stretch out into the sea , afford ever - changing lake scenery at every turn of the road , which winds along the precipitous margin of the lagoons . |

| source.excerpts.13.value | The muleteers , each owning a number of baggage cattle , prefer hiring them all at once , and will not break their caravan for one person : meeting , however , with a Frenchman in the same predicament , we hired cattle jointly , and proposed starting on the 27th : but when the time came , our man having repented of his bargain , did not appear , and , on our sending to the muleteers ' khan , we were informed that he had left for Yaffa .Being all packed up and ready to proceed , this intimation was rather vexatious ; but suspecting that it was intended to throw us off the scent , I told 346 FROM ENGLAND TO CEYLON .I took a clean shirt from my saddle - bags , and was in the act of putting it on , when I fortunately discovered a scorpion three inches long inside it ; these reptiles are very abundant here . |
