How long is this to last ? How long ? Oh , God , have mercy upon me ! How long ? It lasted till the moon grew white in the western sky and the sun rose red in the east ; till the hot rays of noon poured down on the blood - stained field and filled the air with an awful odour of death , bringing forth myriads of buzzing flies to feed on corruption and torture the dying — 25 , 000 men lying maimed or killed under the hot rays of that June sun — it lasted till the sun and moon had changed places yet again , but under grey clouds shedding refreshing raindrops , and through a second day of stupor and despair .Fatigue parties were abroad seeking the wounded and burying the more distinguished dead . |

| source.excerpts.10.value | Mary noticed the momentary sadness in his face , but the next instant it had vanished , and , as notabilities were crowding into the room , she had not time to speculate on its significance ; she wanted to know who everybody was , while every alternate person seemed to be an old comrade of her husband .The witchery of the scene soon banished her forebodings ; her senses were soothed with the sweet scents of the flowers and the rhythmical cadences of the soft music ; she became engrossed in watching the dresses and jewels of the Belgian and English beauties , and the faces and stars of the heroic generals or brilliant princes and nobles who thronged to pay homage to the hostess .She might have danced every dance if she had so willed it , for her girlish loveliness , exquisite dress , and the halo of romance that surrounded her , made her quite a centre of attraction , even in that company ; but she preferred to most of the evening with her husband who , having been in the saddle all day , and having a shrewd guess that he might be called upon to resume his seat therein a few hours later , was not inclined for much exertion . |
