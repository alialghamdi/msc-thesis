| source.excerpts.0.value | 1 ) Smoke Control area , and this was given by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government during 1959 Owing to staff shortages it was only possible to complete the detailed survey of the area following the appointment of a Smoke Control Officer in July 1960 In October i960 the Council agreed to the making of an Order which was submitted to the Minister for confirmation , and is due to come into force in June 1962 Within the area is a large estate of block dwellings , some eighty years of age comprising 480 flats which the owners have undertaken to modernise within the next few years In view of this , these premises have been specifically excluded from the Order .A second smaller area of 37 ¼ acres was also surveyed and reported upon before the end of 1960 and the necessary steps taken to make this the subject of an Order In 1959 the Council formulated its programme for smoke control areas for the subsequent five years to cover approximately 311 acres or just over half the Borough , and it is hoped that the initial delays which occurred will now be overcome by an accelerated rate of progress in implementing this programme FUMES FROM VEHICLES ON THE HIGHWAYS ; Many persons have been concerned in recent years with the emmission of black and oily fumes from vehicles on the roads such emissions being observed by no means infrequently It is nearly always due either to lack of maintenance , defects or maladjustments in the engine or to wilful interference by the drivers of the setting ( even when this is sealed to prevent it being tampered with ) in order to allow the vehicles to acquire a quicker rate of acceleration especially when going up hill for it is at such times when the load on the engine is greatest , and the engine defective that the emission is most likely to occur These fumes are both filthy and oily very unpleasant and a nuisance and at time even a danger as they may obscure vision It is also possible , though admittedly not proven that they are by nature cancer producing Although the nuisance in Finsbury is probably not as great as in some other areas as we have no long steep hills in the Borough yet because considerable nuisances have been reported we asked the Public Health Inspectors in December 1957 .to make a note of the registration number and when possible the name and address of the owner of every vehicle seen to be discharging noisome fumes When the name of the owner was not known I was able to obtain this through the co operation of the Motor Taxation Officer of the appropriate authority , 41 When these reports were presented to me I wrote a friendly letter to the owner calling his attention to the occurrence and asking for his co - operation to prevent a continuance of it In all 107 such instances including 55 in 1960 have been reported , since this procedure was started in the autumn of 1958 , It would seem to me that the procedure adopted which I got from a town in the north of England has been useful though of course in Finsbury such action cannot make more than a minute contribution to the solution . |
