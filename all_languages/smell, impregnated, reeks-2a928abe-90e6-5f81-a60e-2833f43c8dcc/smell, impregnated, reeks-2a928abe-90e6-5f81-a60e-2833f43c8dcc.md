| source.excerpts.0.value | By anassthetising patient with nitrous oxide and rapidly changing to the Ormsby inhaler .In this method the apparatus for giving gas is kept quite distinct from that for administering ether , so that there cannot possibly be any smell of ether about the gas tackle , and patients are never conscious of inhaling anything but N 2 O , and do not complain that your apparatus smells of â   that nasty ether .â   Many authorities pass ether and gas through the ETHER IN DENTAL OPERATIONS . |

| source.excerpts.2.value | This mixture is pleasant to inhale , as the ether forms only one half the volume of the mixture , and on account of its containing chloroform also , very little is poured on the inhaler at a time , and so the pungency of the ether vaj ) our is not noticed .A few patients , those who have a horror of the close - fitting facepiece associated - with nitrous oxide administra - tion , prefer to inhale this mixture previous to etherisa - tion , as it does away with the feeling of sufibcation they experience , when the gas facepiece is applied .The mixture should he freshly made up as re - quired , and not kept in bulk , in order to prevent alteration of its composition by evaporation through a faulty stopper , & c . |

| source.excerpts.3.value | The storage of this stimulus is â   memory .â   In all probability no stimulus is ever lost , nothing is ever really forgotten , and the most trifling incidents of the distant past are often faith - fully revived in dreams , while the repetition at another time and place of some associated stimulus , such as a peculiar scent or sound , will often repro - duce faces and words and scenes of long ago that we fancied had faded altogether from our minds .These revivals are very capricious . |

| source.excerpts.4.value | â   We will suppose that there are only two or three teeth at most , then nitrous oxide can be administered alone until the patient is unconscious , and then by rapidly rotating the ether dome to 2 or 3 , one or two respirations of ether can be given , the inhaler quickly removed , and the teeth extracted .Eecovery is very quick , and the fact that ether has been inhaled may not even be suspected by the patient ; he may complain that the inhaler smells of ether .The patient should always be told that ether has been administered , and should be compelled to remain quiet in the chair longer than if he had only taken nitrous oxide , as upon getting up too soon and going out into the open , he is frequently rendered giddy and sick through seeing the moving traffic of the streets . |

| source.excerpts.5.value | â   In spite of all care in dieting , cases are repeatedly met with , where no food has been taken for five or six hours , and yet upon recovering from ether , vomiting of semi - digested material occurs ; these are generally patients who have worried themselves greatly about the operation .Ether may be administered alone , but as it has a very strong pungent odour , which is regarded by most people as .very unpleasant , and often causes vomiting , coughing , and struggling on the part of the patient , by far the most pleasant method is to give nitrous oxide first and then to change to ether , as by so doing , the patient is relieved of the unpleasant sensation of inhaling the pungent ether vapour , and is only conscious of inhaling nitrous oxide . |

| source.excerpts.6.value | This fact should , in my opinion , be printed in large letters at the entrance of every church and every theatre , and taught to every child in the nursery .A person with a weak heart in a fainting condition , held up and sometimes hugged tight by well - mean - ing friends armed with scent and luke - warm water , is within a measurable distance of being fondled lovingly out of this life altogether , yet how frequent a spectacle it is â   the anxious friend sedulously stopping the heartâ   s action , the curious and kindly circle shutting off the aiiâ   , or at any rate rendering it warm , stuffy , and impure , and the officious by - stander , with a handkerchief reeking with scent , poisoning what little air does reach the patient .With such a scene before the mindâ   s eye , one may feel excused for urging this point of the position of a fainting person . |
