| source.excerpts.9.value | Taking the philosophy of manufacturers I look upon it in terms of an analogy : a masking agent will overpower and change the â   olfactory appearanceâ   ? much as the masks we use for Fancy Dress Balls change the visual appearance .However , if as is claimed , counteractants render the smell nonâ   detectable they would turn one into the Invisible Man .On this basis , addition of a counteractant in increasing amounts would reduce the odour strength to zero and thereafter increase by virtue of excess = generaily somewhat odorous â   of counteractant , much as the dotted line in Fig . |

| source.excerpts.23.value | Odour character is the property that enables us to distinguish between different odours and it is said that an odour with a distinct recognisable character tends to be more annoying .It also , of course , enables us to identify the odour and perhaps associate it with some process or operation which we dislike for other reasons .Hedonic tone is the term used to place an odour on a scale of pleasantness and unpleasantness in a neutral context and differs from acceptability which is a judge - ment made in the context of a specific situation , e . |

Nevertheless Local Authorities do have responsibilities in this field at premises where non - ferrous metals are melted without producing noxious or offensive gases or , in the case of certain metals , without producing dust or Fume .Their operations present unique difficulties , the control of which have caused severe problems to local authorities for many years . |

| source.excerpts.247.value | Recently , however , there seems to be more interest in an alternative form of biological treatment where the odorous air is passed through a bed of soil , peat or compost .The mechanism of odour removal is believed to involve the dissolution of the odorants and oxygen in water followed by their reaction under the influence of enzymes , generated by , or forming part of , the micro - organisms .Therefore odour abatement would be facilitated by a large gas - liquid interface and sufficient microbial activity , conditions which may be provided in either a bed of soil , peat etc , or ina packed tower . |
