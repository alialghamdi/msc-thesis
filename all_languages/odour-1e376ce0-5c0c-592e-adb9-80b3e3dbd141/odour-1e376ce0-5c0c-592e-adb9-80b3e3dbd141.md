| source.excerpts.2.value | Why the olive succeeds better in rocky , stony , or sandy land , than jn argillaceous hard soil , is , because the rocks , stone , and sand accumulate accumulate more heat , and preserve it longer than does argillaceous , or chalky land ; and the sap from the former is less abundant , more pure , and more refined , than from more humid soil .For the same reason aromatic herbs have more rich perfume in rocky , or sandy , than in low , rich soil .It is the same with vines . |

The operation of cutting away the adipose parts , which come off in immense lumps , of from eight inches to a foot , or fifteen inches in depth , is rather laborious ; it is likewise attended attended with the danger of attacks from an immense number of sharks , that instinctively follow the carcase ; and , so soon as it is hewn open , seize whatever falls from it with the most ferocious avidity .Hence , the fishermen are obliged to be extremely careful not to expose their limbs , by allowing them to dangle in the water : such of the crews as fall overboard , are usually snapped snapped up by their greedy competitors ; which , it is said , are known in these parts to grow to the enormous length of thirty feet ! It has often occurred to me , that , in lieu of casting loose the remains of whales , after cutting cutting away the blubber , as our fishermen usually do , an immense quantity of ammonia might be extracted , were the skeletons to be towed to the shore , and there to be applied to that purpose . |
