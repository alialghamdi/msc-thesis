| source.excerpts.0.value | Whence it comes to pass , that those Trees in time ( their strong and far - extended Arms being in many places thus support ∣ ed ) grow to a very great height , and extend themselves to such an incredible breadth , they growing round every way , as that hundreds of men may shade themselves under one of them at any time ; the rather , because these , as all other Trees in those Southern parts of East - India ( as particularly I observed before ) still keep on their green Coats .For their Flowers , they are for the generality like unto painted Weeds , which , though their colour be excellent , they rather delight the eye than affect the smell ; for not many of them , except Roses , and some few kinds more , are any whit fragrant : Amongst them that are , there is one white Flower , like to Spa ∣ nish Jessamin ( if it be not the same ) which is exceedingly well sented , of which they make a most excellent pure sweet Oil , with which they anoint their heads , and other parts of their bodies ; which makes the company of those that do so very savoury and sweet .This Empire is watered with many goodly Rivers ( as they are expressed in the Map ) the two principal are Indus and Ganges ; where this thing is very observable ( for they say there , that it is very true ) that one pint of the water of Ganges weigheth less by one ounce than any other water in that whole great Monar ∣ chy . |

| source.excerpts.10.value | ) These Salvages had their Cattell which we bought of them , at a very great Command : for with a call they would presently run to them , and when they had sold any one of their Bullocks to us , for a little inconsiderate piece of brass , if we did not presently knock him down , they would by the same call , make the poor creature break from us , and run unto them again ; and then there was no getting them out of their hands but by giving them more brass : and by this trick , now and then , they sold the same beast unto us , two or three times ; and if they had thus sold him more often , he had been a good penny - worth ; how ever in this we might observe , the covetousness and deceit of this brutish people .Here ye must know , that this people of all metals seem to love Brass , I think ( as you may ghess afterward ) for the rankness of its smell ; with which they make great Rings to wear about their Wrists ; yea , so taken are they with this base metal , that if a man lay down before them a piece of Gold worth two pounds sterling , and a piece of brass worth two pence , they will leave the Gold and take the brass .On this shore there likewise are found excellent good , though small Roots for Salads , which the soyl brings forth without husbanding . |

| source.excerpts.11.value | In the Evening the Ministers of the Temple ring a kind of Bell or Shell which was within the Temple , striking it with a staff ; and it made a tolerable sound , as if it had been a good Bell : at which sound , some from without assembling together , they be ∣ gin to sound within the Temple very loud two Drums , and two Pipes or Flutes of metal ; after which many Tapers being light ∣ ed , particularly , at the Steccato above - mention ' d , and put in order a little quilt with a Canopy of rich Stuff , which is alwayes ready in the Temple for carrying the Idol , they put the princi ∣ pal Idol Virenà into it , not that of ordinary wood in the middle of the Temple , but the other at the upper end , which was of the same bigness , about two spans round between the figure and ornaments about it , but all painted with various colours , gilded and deck ' d with white Flowers .Then one of the Ministers march ' d first sounding a Bell continually as he went , and after him others , and at length two with lighted Tapers , after which followed the Idol in his Canopy , with a Minister before him carrying a Vessel of Perfumes , which he burnt ; and thus they carry ' d him in Procession : First , into the Court without the Temple , going out of it on the left Hand , as you enter , which to them as they came forth was the right , and returning by the other opposite .After which going out of the Gate of the Court into the street , they went in the same manner in Procession , ( still sounding their Bells ) I know not whither , but ' tis likely they went to some other Temple to perform some kind of Ce ∣ remony ; for in the Town there was more then one . |
