| source.excerpts.0.value | But one who knew his history and marked the occasional twitching of the mouth under the heavy moustache , and the flash of the steel grey eye , sharp as a scimitar , could detect the French irritability and frivolity which were masked under the Turkish phlegm .He did his duty , however , thoroughly and well , and enjoyed the confidence of several successive Viceroys , different in all respects ; dying in harness at last , a very old man , in the full odour of Egyptian Pacha - dom .He was a good soldier and a stern martinet , and greatly improved the efficiency and discipline of the Egyptian army . |

| source.excerpts.2.value | The gleaming white walls of the palace of Eas el Tin , which first strike the traveller ' s eye on entering the harbour of Alexandria , mark one of his favourite resorts .Another was the garden of Shoubra , near Cairo , in which he built a spacious kiosque of white marble , embowered in tropical foliage , where the golden orange glows in the midst of the dark green foliage , and the senses ache with the perfume of roses and other fragrant flowers .It was a lofty building in the form of a hollow square ; and in the central open space , over which there was no roof , like the old impluvium , was an artificial lake , about four feet deep , paved with marble , with an elevated marble resting - place in the centre . |

| source.excerpts.3.value | His version , however , of the utterances and doings of the early Israelites varies considerably , in many instances , from our accepted version of them ; and one of these discrepancies relates to the proceedings of Joseph during the seven years of famine that succeeded the seven years of plenty in Egypt , after 148 Egypt under its Khedives .hidden by the smoke which fills the windowless den , without chimney or other aperture to admit light or air , save the open doorway — all his senses of sight , of smell , of hearing , of touch , of taste , will be equally revolted .Yet in huts like these do the great mass of the fellah population live , and propagate blear - eyed and unhealthy children , from generation to generation ; secreting and hoarding what money they may earn , without any attempt or desire to improve a condition and style of life which would prove utterly unbearable and immeasurably wretched to any other agricultural class in the world . |

| source.excerpts.5.value | But , like the mirage of the desert , with the old Ezbekieh these sights and sounds , so truly Oriental , have passed away from the vision of the traveller , as he sits on the verandah of his hotel .All is now decorous , dull and European in the prim gardens , which usurp a portion of that vanished pleasure ground , which , picturesque as it was , must be confessed to have been a public nuisance in many respects , however sentimental sentimental may bewail the substitution of cleanliness and order for dirt and disorder , savoury for unsavoury smells .Much sentimental rubbish has been written about this improvement of Cairo ; but , in a sanitary sanitary and progressive point of view , no sensible man or woman , however sentimental , can deny the improvement and growth of Cairo , under the demolishing tendencies of the Khedive . |

| source.excerpts.6.value | 229 the prim rows of straight poplar ; the same quaint oldfashioned oldfashioned towns and villages , looking precisely alike ; the same ever - recurring types of population , plainly distinguishable distinguishable each by its peculiar dress , as soldier or priest , bourgeois or countryman — offer little to excite or amuse the traveller , whirled by express through La Belle France , until he reaches Paris , the only city in the world where every human being feels himself at home .As far behind us now in thought and feeling ( though but a week has elapsed since we left her hospitable shores ) , as if centuries and the whole globe divided us , must Egypt now be to the returned pilgrim of our widely different civilization ; but the memory of the land and of the people , like the subtle perfume which still scents the mummy - cloth after thousands of years , lingers and must ever abide with those , who have visited and dwelt in the Old House of 16 Egypt under its Khedives .Khedive himself , who has inclined a serious ear to the proposition . |
