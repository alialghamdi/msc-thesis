| source.excerpts.269.value | Many investigators have contended that under all circumstances it is given out again from the body without chemical alteration ; but late experiments have invalidated this position , and the truth would seem to be that up to a certain extent , probably to the amount of one and a half to two ounces of alcohol taken properly diluted in the twenty - four hours , it is oxidised in the body ; the discrepancy arising from two chief causes , first , that when alcohol has been observed in the excretions it had been given in larger doses than that mentioned , an amount which all admit cannot be disposed of by oxidation ; and secondly from the fact that in the urine of some persons who have never taken alcohol , and in the brain , liver , and muscles of some animals , a sub - stance has been found in small quantities which gives the reaction of alcohol .It is said that alcohol escapes as such by the breath of drunkards , but it is probable that acetone and other deriva - tives of the accompanying ethers are the cause of the supposed alcoholic odour .It may , then , be taken as certain that a large amount of absorbed alcohol is oxidised in the body , but in what part this process takes place , or into what new forms it is changed , is as yet unknown . |
