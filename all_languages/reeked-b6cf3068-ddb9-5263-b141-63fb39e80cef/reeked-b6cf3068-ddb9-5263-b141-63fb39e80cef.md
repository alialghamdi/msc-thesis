| source.excerpts.13.value | Still it was not until the Middle Ages that sexual flagellation achieved a systematic development and expansion which came about through its connection with religion , as presented to us in the phenomena of flagellantism or whipping pil - grimages and monasterial discipline .The flogging sport with the accom - panying aura and aroma of sanctimoniousness which called forth , in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries , such insane cramps of passion and pain , became in later times confined to the " discipline " whose " sine qua non " was immoral exposure .The latter began with an " upper " exposure and later descended until it became a lower one , and in this latter process the flogging of the rump played the chief part . |

From satirical allusions scattered through the magazines and pam - phlets of those days one derives an unmistakably clear idea of the true nature of those gatherings in the Temple of Health , and near the celestial bed â   not to speak of what was enacted upon it . |

| source.excerpts.18.value | Sometimes he indicates the obscene interest by paraphrasing â   as in the song " Et Csetera , " which begins by describing how , in a dark and silent grove fit for the delights of love , he lay on Corinna ' s breast apanting .On other occasions he just revels in the foulest conceivable words , as in the " Wish , " which must have resulted from an attack of satyriasis , in which he prays that by some chymick art he could convert to sperm his heart and vitals , and at one thrust translate his very soul into his woman so that he would be steeped in the ardent and fetid darkness of lust .The grandi - ose satanic obscenity achieved in this last poem has been duplicated by only one modern writer who must surely have read Rochester : Edmond Haraucourt in his " Legende des sexes . |
