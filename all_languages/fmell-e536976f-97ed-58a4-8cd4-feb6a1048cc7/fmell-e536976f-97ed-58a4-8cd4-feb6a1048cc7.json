To sooth the hovering foul be thine the care , With plaintive cries to lead the mournful band ; In fable weeds the golden vase to bear , And cull my ashes with thy trembling hand Panchaia ' s odours be their costly feast , And all the pride of Asia ' s fragrant year Give them the treasures of the farthest Last , And , what is still more precious , give thy tear , Surely no blame can fall upon a nymph who rejected rejected a swain of so little meaning .His verses are not rugged , but they have no sweetness sweetness ; they never glide in a stream of melody .",
