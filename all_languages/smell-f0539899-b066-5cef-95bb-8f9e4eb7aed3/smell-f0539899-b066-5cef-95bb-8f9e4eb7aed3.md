| source.excerpts.11.value | Hence he concludes , that it is improvident to reject the first eighth , since it contains about one - twelfth of the acid obtained , and there is no circumstance rendering it necessary to have distilled vinegar either of very equal or very great strength .Of late distilled acetic acid is prepared in many places as an article of manufactory , and of very great strength and purity , from pyrolignic acid , by depriving it of its empy - reuma , so that it is now getting into use even at table ; but for this purpose it is certainly inferior , as indeed the best dis - tilled acid is ; for although sufficiently sour , it wants that pleasant aroma , which characterizes the best white wine vine - gar obtained by fermentation .It answers , however , remark - ably well for all chemical and pharmaceutic purposes , as it is procured so strong that it must be diluted with water to re - duce it to the strength of distilled vinegar . |

| source.excerpts.23.value | The greater number of oils require for their distillation the heat of water strongly boiling ; but there are many also which rise with a heat considerably less ; such as those of lemon and citron peel , of the flowâ   ers of lavender and rosemary , and of almost all the more odoriferous kinds of flowers .We have already observed , that these flowers have their fragrance much injured , or even destroyed , by beating and bruising them ; it is impaired also by the immersion in water in the present pro - ? cess , and the more so in proportion to the continuance of the immersion and the heat ; hence oils , distilled in the common manner , prove much less agreeable in smell than the subjects themselves .For the distillation of substances of this class , another method has been contrived : instead of being immer - sed in water , they are exposed only to its vapour . |
