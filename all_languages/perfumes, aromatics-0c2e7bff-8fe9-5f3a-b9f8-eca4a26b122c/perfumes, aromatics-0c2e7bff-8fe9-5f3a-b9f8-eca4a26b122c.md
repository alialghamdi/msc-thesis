| source.excerpts.0.value | Like the calces of mercury , this bath effects the gums and the salivary glands , giving rise occasionally to a plentiful ptyalism .Though it reddens the gums , swells them , and renders them somevLat tender , it never produces that nauseous smell , nor those foetid ulcerations which arise from mercury ; nor from the bath , did I ever know the least injury arise to the teeth ._ If the gums are much affected from the bath , it is generally prudent to stop its use , or to diminish the absorption , by expos - ing a smaller surface to it . |

| source.excerpts.1.value | That there are people of contrary opinions , I will not pretend to question , but they are generally those whose experience is little , or whose success on their arrival has made them view everything through the pleasing medium of pro - motion or pleasure ; like the young lady , who , having luckily got a husband three weeks after her landing , wrote home to her friends in the commencement of the honey - moon , â   that the black men were very amiable ^ and Calcutta a perfect ' paradise P â   â   Of the deleterious effects of the climate , no language can convey an idea .The fogs and pestilential vapours in the islands of Java , Sumatra , Borneo , Bali , Macassar and Celebes , are odoriferous gales , when compared to those of India , and I look upon the inhabitants in the vicinity of the Bohun Upas , as truly enviable to those in every part of Hindoostan ; they who reside near the poison - tree are only incommoded when the wind blows from a certain quarter , but in India , every gale carries disease on its wings , and leaves bile and debility behind it .â   â   During the solstitial rains and equinoctial hurricanes , there is scarcely any place of shelter or protection in the country . |

| source.excerpts.3.value | 7 50 LINES WRITTEN IN A CHOULTRY , Whose massy columns countless glow , Keflected in the tank below , Whose endless porticos and halls , Whose pillarâ   d domes , and echoing walls , Its proud magnificence attest , The child of poverty may rest ! â   Here wealth gives no exclusive claim , No deference to a noble name ; To all the race of man as free As heavenâ   s cerulean canopy .Long may the pious fabric stand Amid this boundless waste of sand ; Like some blest islandâ   s friendly cove , To those who on the ocean rove ! The veriest wretch , while shelterâ   d here , Shrinks from no fellow - mortalâ   s sneer , Whose broken spirit ill could brook A purse - proud landlordâ   s scornful look ; But , safe from noonâ   s destructive force , May pause upon his toilsome course , With food and rest his frame renew , His homeward journey to pursue ; And , at the welcome close of light , When fire - flies take their evening flight , And hover round each fragrant fiowâ   r ; When burning skies have lost their powâ   r .When with fresh hopes , and thankful heart , He girds his loins in act to part . |

| source.excerpts.4.value | Sir , â   There has been lately brought from the East Indies an article which promises to occupy a distinguished place in the Materia Medica ; I allude to the Narvallum Gotta oil , as it is called , which is obtained from the seeds of the Croton Tiglium , or Grana Molucca .The former is a dark yellow or brownish liquid , rather viscid than otherwise , possessing little scent ; the latter are whitish unctuous kernels , each about the size of a coffee berry , enclosed in a slight husk or shell .The efficacy of this oil in producing evacuations is astonishingly great . |

| source.excerpts.6.value | The annotators of the passage quoted from Horace observe , that the hothrum or bethrum was brought from India to Syria , and from thence to Rome .It appears evident that Horace speaks of it as an unguent or perfume for the hair , and Pliny also mentions that it was used as such by the Rom ^ ans , who mixed it up with other fragrant odours of the east .Stephanus in his Greek lexicon says , that Malabathrum grew in Malabar , and that in the language of that part of India it is called bathrum or bethrum and that by joining the two words together , the Greeks formed Malabathrum . |

| source.excerpts.9.value | What soil there is , is spongy .A few birch bushes are yet seen ; but a large and strong ground - tree or creeper overspreads the ground , somewhat in the manner of furze or brambles ; and it is a curious fact that the wood of this is , we think , that of which the cases of black - lead pencils are made , being of a fine brittle , yet soft red grain ; and the smell is the same as of that used for the pencils , and which has hitherto been called by us cedar .I have specimens of this wood ; it is called , I think , Ghandan : I saw it on the summit of the Ghour peak , and in the snowy regions of Kunaur , but did not then examine it . |
