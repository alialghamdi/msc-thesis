| source.excerpts.20.value | The conclusion that while the changes produced in nerve - centres correspond to feelings , the discharges through nerve - fibres correspond to the relations among feelings , harmonizes with the fact that these lines of communication through which relations are established , are most nume - rous in those parts where the greatest numbers of separate feelings are initiated and combined : the extreme instance being furnished by the organs of vision , which are distin - guished alike by the multitudinousness of the fibres they contain and by the multitudinousness of the related feel - ings which are excited in them to form a visual image .It is a trait of nervous structure that the numerous fibres proceeding from any specialized part , such as a sense - organ , to a nervous centre , are more closely connected with one another , centrally as well as peripherally , than they are with the fibres proceeding from other such parts to their centres ; and a corresponding trait of consciousness is that feelings of the same order are more associable with one another than feelings of different orders : colours being more readily connected in thought with colours than they are with sounds , sounds more readily with sounds than with colours , smells with smells more readily than with touches .This holds with genera and species of feelings â   the most nearly alike being the most associable ; and , conversely , there is 505 / CONGRUITIES . |
