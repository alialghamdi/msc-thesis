| source.excerpts.4.value | Travellers have compared the Omerians to various families of aquatic birds delighting in swamps and misty mornings : but though quagmires are more numerous than meadows , and snipes than sheep , the neighbourhood neighbourhood is free from imputation of either ague or rheumatism ; and the complexions of the women and children tell no tales of malaria and miasmata , yvhich might reasonably have been anticipated from the position of the place .It is one of the old third - class fortresses of the Country , â   planned , I believe , by Vauban , â   but considering its present and , yve may say , its future inutility as a Ville fortifiee , the Mayor and Corporation , with permission from head - quarters , yvould exhibit sound judgment in clearing the moats of the green stagnant and fetid water , and converting them into allotments for vegetable growers , or into promenades , where the at present cooped - up population might walk about and dispel ennui and migraine , â   the only invaders they may ever have to dread .Sheltered in such a walled garden , the cauliflowers and tomatas , melons and cucumbers , would defy wind and frost ; and the substratum of mud , a virgin soil of four yards ' depth , would rival the richest mellow loam of the Brazils . |

| source.excerpts.5.value | More than forty eventful years have elapsed since the author of this volume , wending his way through the Via Tordinona in Rome , aster a long day spent amid the treasures of the Vatican , turned aside , for mere love of exploring terra incognita , to ascertain how near to the flowing waters of the Tiber he yvould find himself , by threading one of those little narrow arched passages which open into the said street at one end , and descend to the river ' s bank at the other .The vicolo here alluded to ( for that is the term applied to these covered lanes or courts , ) was that del arco di 1 had passed it at least two hundred times , in the course of nine months , only to regard it , in common yvith several other lying in the same direction , as a defile of darkness and bad odours , serving , probably , as a short cut for water - carriers and scavengers to and from the main street ; but the memory is still fresh as ever of the delight with yvhich , on emerging from this repulsive by - way , I found myself standing on a projection of i .52 BY - ROADS AND BATTLE - FIELDS . |

It was a hooded car , which soon became a retort of smoke , as , from the head of every lane leading from the outlying outlying villages into the carriage - road , each letter - carrier jumped up , and began to whiff his Tabac du Caporal , and greet his brother messenger with the current news of the day .What a mail that was ! If asked to describe it I should say it was a machine facetiously contrived to ascertain the power of resistance in the vertebral process of a strong , stout , healthy man . |
