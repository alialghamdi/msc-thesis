| source.excerpts.0.value | For the resources of trees are not developed until they have difficulty to contend with ; neither their tenderness of brotherly love and harmony , till they are forced to choose their ways of various life where there is contracted room for them , talking to each other with their restrained branches .The various action of trees rooting themselves in inhospitable rocks , stooping to look into ravines , hiding from the search of glacier winds , reaching forth to the rays of rare sunshine , crowding down together to drink at sweetest streams , climbing hand in hand among the difficult slopes , opening in sudden dances round the mossy knolls , gathering into companies at rest among the fragrant fields , gliding in grave procession over the heavenward ridges - - nothing of this can be conceived among the unvexed and unvaried felicities of the lowland forest : while to all these direct sources of greater beauty are added , first the power of redundance , - - the mere quantity of foliage visible in the folds and on the promontories of a single Alp being greater than that of an entire lowland landscape ( unless a view from some cathedral tower ) ; and to this charm of redundance , that of clearer _ visibility _ , - - tree after tree being constantly shown in successive height , one behind another , instead of the mere tops and flanks of masses , as in the plains ; and the forms of multitudes of them continually defined against the clear sky , near and above , or against white clouds entangled among their branches , instead of being confused in dimness of distance .Finally , to this supremacy in foliage we have to add the still less questionable supremacy in clouds . |

| source.excerpts.1.value | Tracking , with an attention always alert , the whole process of their production to its starting - point in the deep places of the mind , he seems to realise the but half - conscious intuitions of Hogarth or Shakespeare , and develops the great ruling unities which have swayed their actual work ; or " puts up , " and takes , the one morsel of good stuff in an old , forgotten writer .Even in what he says casually there comes an aroma of old English ; noticeable echoes , in chance turn and phrase , of the great masters of style , the old masters .Godwin , seeing in quotation a passage from _ John Woodvil _ , takes it for a choice fragment of an old dramatist , and goes to Lamb to assist him in finding the author . |

| source.excerpts.2.value | And besides the fragrance from these local sources , there were traces of scents brought from afar .For this wind came first from the sea , rubbing against its fresh , briny waves , then distilled through the redwoods , threading rich ferny gulches , and spreading itself in broad undulating currents over many a flower - enameled ridge of the coast mountains , then across the golden plains , up the purple foot - hills , and into these piny woods with the varied incense gathered by the way .Winds are advertisements of all they touch , however much or little we may be able to read them ; telling their wanderings even by their scents alone . |

| source.excerpts.3.value | To this more high - pitched feeling , since predominant in our literature , the writings of Charles Lamb , whose life occupies the last quarter of the eighteenth century and the first quarter of the nineteenth , are a transition ; and such union of grave , of terrible even , with gay , we may note in the circumstances of his life , as reflected thence into his work .We catch the aroma of a singular , homely sweetness about his first years , spent on Thames ' side , amid the red bricks and terraced gardens , with their rich historical memories of old - fashioned legal London .Just above the poorer class , deprived , as he says , of the " sweet food of academic institution , " he is fortunate enough to be reared in the classical languages at an ancient school , where he becomes the companion of Coleridge , as at a later period he was his enthusiastic disciple . |

| source.excerpts.5.value | We hear much nowadays concerning the universal struggle for existence , but no struggle in the common meaning of the word was manifest here ; no recognition of danger by any tree ; no deprecation ; but rather an invincible gladness , as remote from exultation as from fear .I kept my lofty perch for hours , frequently closing my eyes to enjoy the music by itself , or to feast quietly on the delicious fragrance that was streaming past .The fragrance of the woods was less marked than that produced during warm rain , when so many balsamic buds and leaves are steeped like tea ; but from the chafing of resiny branches against each other , and the incessant attrition of myriads of needles , the gale was spiced to a very tonic degree . |

| source.excerpts.6.value | Some of us are wise in this way naturally and by genius ; some of us never become so .But to have spent one ' s youth at college , in contact with the choice and rare and precious , and yet still to be a blind prig or vulgarian , unable to scent out human excellence or to divine it amid its accidents , to know it only when ticketed and labeled and forced on us by others , this indeed should be accounted the very calamity and shipwreck of a higher education .The sense for human superiority ought , then , to be considered our line , as boring subways is the engineer ' s line and the surgeon ' s is appendicitis . |

| source.excerpts.9.value | " Above all , he becomes not merely an expositor , permanently valuable , but for Englishmen almost the discoverer of the old English drama ." The book is such as I am glad there should be , " he modestly says of the _ Specimens of English Dramatic Poets who lived about the time of Shakespeare _ ; to which , however , he adds in a series of notes the very quintessence of criticism , the choicest savour and perfume of Elizabethan poetry being sorted , and stored here , with a sort of delicate intellectual epicureanism , which has had the effect of winning for these , then almost forgotten , poets , one generation after another of enthusiastic students .Could he but have known how fresh a source of culture he was evoking there for other generations , through all those years in which , a little wistfully , he would harp on the limitation of his time by business , and sigh for a better fortune in regard to literary opportunities ! To feel strongly the charm of an old poet or moralist , the literary charm of Burton , for instance , or Quarles , or The Duchess of Newcastle ; and then to interpret that charm , to convey it to others - - he seeming to himself but to hand on to others , in mere humble ministration , that of which for them he is really the creator - - this is the way of his criticism ; cast off in a stray letter often , or passing note , or lightest essay or conversation . |

| source.excerpts.11.value | Winds are advertisements of all they touch , however much or little we may be able to read them ; telling their wanderings even by their scents alone .Mariners detect the flowery perfume of land - winds far at sea , and sea - winds carry the fragrance of dulce and tangle far inland , where it is quickly recognized , though mingled with the scents of a thousand land - flowers .As an illustration of this , I may tell here that I breathed sea - air on the Firth of Forth , in Scotland , while a boy ; then was taken to Wisconsin , where I remained nineteen years ; then , without in all this time having breathed one breath of the sea , I walked quietly , alone , from the middle of the Mississippi Valley to the Gulf of Mexico , on a botanical excursion ; and while in Florida , far from the coast , my attention wholly bent on the splendid tropical vegetation about me , I suddenly recognized a sea - breeze , as it came sifting through the palmettos and blooming vine - tangles , which at once awakened and set free a thousand dormant associations , and made me a boy again in Scotland , as if all the intervening years had been annihilated . |

| source.excerpts.12.value | If we attribute this difference between the monkeys and the pike solely to the association of ideas being so much stronger and more persistent in the one than the other , though the pike often received much the more severe injury , can we maintain in the case of man that a similar difference implies the possession of a fundamentally different mind ? Houzeau relates that , while crossing a wide and arid plain in Texas , his two dogs suffered greatly from thirst , and that between thirty and forty times they rushed down the hollows to search for water .These hollows were not valleys , and there were no trees in them , or any other difference in the vegetation , and as they were absolutely dry , there could have been no smell of damp earth .The dogs behaved as if they knew that a dip in the ground offered them the best chance of finding water , and Houzeau has often witnessed the same behaviour in other animals . |

| source.excerpts.16.value | Together with this great source of pre - eminence in _ mass _ of colour , we have to estimate the influence of the finished inlaying and enamel - work of the colour - jewellery on every stone ; and that of the continual variety in species of flower ; most of the mountain flowers being , besides , separately lovelier than the lowland ones .The wood hyacinth and the wild rose are , indeed , the only _ supreme _ flowers that the lowlands can generally show ; and the wild rose is also a mountaineer , and more fragrant in the hills , while the wood hyacinth , at its best , cannot match even the dark bell - gentian , leaving the light - blue star - gentian in its uncontested queenliness , and the Alpine rose and Highland heather wholly without similitude .The violet , lily of the valley , crocus , and wood anemone are , I suppose , claimable partly by the plains as well as the hills ; but the large orange lily and narcissus I have never seen but on hill pastures , and the exquisite oxalis is pre - eminently a mountaineer . |
