| source.excerpts.0.value | Conspicuous in the foreground is the skunk ( Mephitis mephitica ) , belonging to a genus of the weasel family found only in America .This animal is MediaWiki : Proofreadpage pagenum templatecelebrated for its power of ejecting a terribly offensive liquid , the odour of which is almost intolerable .The skunks are nocturnal animals , and are generally marked , as in the species represented , with conspicuous bands and patches of white . |

| source.excerpts.1.value | For in that case numbers of winged insects would certainly have entered , and the flowers would then , as in every other part of the world , have been rendered attractive to them by the development of coloured petals ; and this character once acquired would long maintain itself , even if the insects had , from some unknown cause , subsequently disappeared .After the preceding paragraphs were written , it occurred to me , that if this reasoning were correct , New Zealand plants ought to be also deficient in scented flowers ; because it is a part of the same theory , that the odours of flowers have , like their colours , been developed to attract the insects required to aid in their fertilization .I therefore at once applied to my friend Dr . |

| source.excerpts.2.value | The Insectivora now often maintain themselves amidst more highly developed forms , by means of some special protection .Some burrow in the earth , — like the moles ; others have a spiny covering , — as the hedgehog ' s and several of the Centetidæ ; others are aquatic , — - as the Potamogale and the desman ; others have a nauseous odour , — as the shrews ; while there are several which seem to be preserved by their resemblance to higher forms , — as the elephant - shrews to jerboas , and the tupaias to squirrels .The same need of protection is shown by the numerous Insectivora inhabiting Madagascar , where the competing forms are few ; and by one lingering in the Antilles , where there are hardly any other mammalia . |

| source.excerpts.3.value | Hooker , as the highest authority on New Zealand botany ; simply asking whether there was any such observed deficiency .His reply MediaWiki : Proofreadpage pagenum templatewas : — " New Zealand plants are remarkably scentless , both in regard to the rarity of scented flowers , of leaves with immersed glands containing essential oils , and of glandular hairs ." There are a few exceptional cases , but these seem even more rare than might be expected , so that the confirmation of theory is very complete . |

| source.excerpts.8.value | The two former , however , are genera of wide range , which may have originated in New Zealand by the introduction of plants with handsome flowers , which the few indigenous insects would be attracted by , and thus prevent the loss of their gay corollas ; so that these discoveries will not much affect the general character of the flora , and its very curious bearing on the past history of the islands through the relations of flowers and insects .In judging of the relation here supposed to exist , it must be remembered , that if the New Zealand insects have been introduced from the surrounding countries by chance immigrations at distant intervals , then , as we go back into the past the insect fauna will become poorer and poorer , and still more inadequate than at present to lead to the development of attractive flowers and odours .This quite harmonizes with the fact of the ancient indigenous flora being so remarkably scentless and inconspicuous , while a few of the more recently introduced genera of plants have retained their floral attractions . |
