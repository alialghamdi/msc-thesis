| source.excerpts.2.value | Bloomsbury was not exempt from the hawker ' s cry , and yet the shrill voices heralding heralding the spring ' s approach brought gladsome memories before the tired sufferers of life ' s campaign .Invalids recalled the beauty of sunlit clovered fields , the rambles through the tall flower - scented grass , the cosy woodland woodland nooks , the violets under the elms and hedgerows , all things sweet and fair , making toilsome lives forget their slavery as spring flowers deck the smoke - stained casements , and hope is once more inhaled with the refreshing fragrance .Or they may speak of the soft and lustrous splendour of the moonlight , before cynicism taught us to sneer at romance and the sighs of some sylphide in white muslin and low shoes . |

The gardens at the Hall were already fragrant with the perfumes of myriads of blossoms ; this fair midland retreat might have suggested a poetic vision of Arcadia — home of the so tempting tempting were its beauties , its verdant lawns , its silvery lake winding beneath glorious foliage towards silent groves and bowers wreathed with myrtles and honeysuckles .But the Hall was scarcely the celestial abode it may have appeared to outsiders — weary pilgrims from parched cities , who occasionally peered through the iron gates at the grand old mansion and grounds . |
