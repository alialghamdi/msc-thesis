| source.excerpts.0.value | We now found ourselves in a broad street which had dwellings on both sides of it , whose height and width left nothing to be desired .The tempera - ture was mild , the air free from unpleasant odors , and I felt not the slightest difficulty in breathing .Farther along there were several cross - streets , and my guide called my attention to a rosen ( a window or hole in the ceiling for air ) , which , like three others that I saw afterwards , was closed up from above . |
