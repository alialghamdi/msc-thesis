But , secondly , this connexion of instinct with bodily sensation , though probable enough in some in - stances , is by no means generally evident .We may INSTINCT OF INSECTS , explain in this way the instincts connected with hun - ger and the sexual passion , and some other particular facts , as the laying of the eggs of the flesh - fly in the flowers of Stapelia hirsuta , instead of in carrion their proper nidus , and of those of the common house - fly in snuffa instead of dung ; for in these instances the smell seems so clearly the guide , that it even leads into error .But what connexion between sensation and instinct do we see in the conduct of the working - bees , which fabri - cate some of the cells in a comb larger than others , ex - pressly to contain the eggs and future grubs of drones , though these eggs are not laid by themselves , and are still in the ovaries of the queen ? So , we may plau - sibly enough conjecture that the fury with which , in ordinary circumstances , at a certain period of the year , the working - bees are inspired towards the drones , is the effect of some disagreeable smell or emanation pro - ceeding from them at that particular time : but how can we explain on similar grounds , the fact that in a hive deprived of a queen , no massacre of the drones takes place ? Lastly , to omit here a hundred other instances , as many of them will be subsequently ad - verted to , if we may with some show of reason sup - pose that it is the sensation of heat which causes bees to swarm ; yet what possible conception can we form of its being bodily sensations that lead bees to send out scouts in search of a hive suitable for the new colony , several days before swarming ? * Dr , Zinke genannt Sommer says , that if in August and September a snuff - box be left open , it will be seen to be frequented by the common house - fly ( Musca domestica ) , the eggs of which will be found to have been deposited amongst the snuff .",

        "value": "\" As to one of these theatres , its pent - up situation , its age â   over 30 years â   and its manifold sanitary imperfections in the front part of the house , may be taken as sufficient reasons for the objections to inspection of the back ; but with regard to the other , I had hoped to be able to describe it as a theatre which , being one of the most recently erected , might be accepted as a type of what a small comedy theatre should be , in the same way as one is able to point to another as a type of all that is best suited for the home of grand opera , and to a third as an almost ideal theatre for the requirements of light comic opera .However , during a visit to the front , when I occupied a seat in the stalls , on the prompt side , a strong whiff of carbolic acid which assailed my nostrils each time the door to that portion of the auditorium opened , indicated that the condition of the urinal in the adjacent lobby was far from perfect ; and I further learned that another similar convenience opens directly into the pit ; so one may assume that however well the building is constructed with an eye to the beautiful , and with all modern improvements for scenic display , the sanitary arrangements have not been equally successful in conception , or , it may be , in execution .Of the 20 theatres which I did visit , it may be said at the outsel that in many the arrangements , from a sanitary point of view , are the reverse of satisfactory ; indeed , there is hardly one in which some fault may not be detected .",
