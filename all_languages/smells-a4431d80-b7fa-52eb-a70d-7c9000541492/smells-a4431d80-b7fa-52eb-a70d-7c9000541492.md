| source.excerpts.0.value | Yet as one approaches the stream by slopes of the usual coulee , densely bushed with poplar and wild fruit trees ; or , coming down open grass , enters a grove of cottonwood along the level bottom , one begins to note that the horses appear to be nervous .A bunch of loose ponies will let the wisest mare scout ahead while they string out in single file to follow all alert , picking their way most delicately , pointing their ears at all sorts of smells and sounds , and glancing backward RACE - MEMORIES OF PERIL 65 often as they go .Again one watches tame horses watering at a trough , always alert , on guard . |

| source.excerpts.2.value | The more vivid perfume of cattle I have caught up easily at four - and - a - half miles on the wind , but by their conduct I think my horses had that savour some miles before it reached my duller senses .I think the scenting powers of a horse are about ten times as strong as mine .Sight . |

| source.excerpts.3.value | So far as I could get any direct evidence , I never knew a horse to see anything at much more than a couple of hundred yards .It seems to be only in civilization where the smells and sounds are bewildering , that the horse becomes longÂ ¬ sighted up to perhaps a mile .Hearing . |

| source.excerpts.4.value | Once I took a range horse into a forest where there were flocks of sheep , herded a good deal of nights by cougars ( Felix cohcoIot j who prospered on their mutton .These cougars used to come round my camp , liked it , I think , because there was no gun - smell , and sang most wonderfully , sitting so near that I could see the gleam of firelight on their eyes .I liked them , but mv horse would stand astride the fire trembling . |

| source.excerpts.6.value | To pass the time of day with other horses , shy at the 92 THOUGHT TRANSFERENCE clouds , paw the moon , and dance , with pig jumping or even a little bucking after breakÂ ¬ fast , are signals of youth , joy and good fellowÂ ¬ ship .Then one may watch the play of the nostrils making a thousand comments on scents borne in the air , while the ears will point and quiver to all sorts of sounds beyond manâ   s hearing .The mood will change from sober thoughtfulÂ ¬ ness in the shadow of clouds or trees , to sheer intoxication of delight with sparkling frost , dew on the flowers , sunshine in the skies . |

| source.excerpts.7.value | Under range conditions the kerchief is more useful round oneâ   s neck , for the nostrils are dry , and , both in horse and man , the senses are more active .At half a mile I have smelt a mountain riverâ   like a wet knife .Once , at about five miles on a windless day my two horses snuffed a fresh pool and bolted for it at SCENT AND SIGHT 193 full gallop despite my frantic protests at their apparent madness . |

| source.excerpts.8.value | The bush beside the water is apt to be full of snakes who come down as horses do , to drink in the gloaming , and are not easily seen .The bush beside the water is the lurking place of every beast of prey , and everybody knows how horses go stark mad at the smell of bear .What chance had the ponies , strung out on a bush trail , against grey timber wolves ? What thoroughbred fighting horse would ever have a chance against the 66 THE HAREM Siberian tiger , or the African lion ? Cougar , puma , jaguar , leopardâ   the cats of all the world with their sudden spring at the withers or throat of a range pony , have taught his descendants their art of self - defence . |

| source.excerpts.9.value | And yet , judging by the constant signalling of a horseâ   s ears which point at every sound , I think his sense of hearing catches vibrations above the register of human ears , and many notes at close range too faint to impress our senses .Whatever a horse may smell , hear or see , he points out with nice gestures of the ears and nostrils which are of infinite value for a man to read and understand .They convey to the pracÂ ¬ tised eye all sorts of warnings and useful little hints . |

| source.excerpts.10.value | The barriers between horse and man are tremendous .Think what it is for a fastidious creature , with powers of scenting which can descry clean standing water at nearly five miles without wind , to come near a meat - eating creature like a man , powerfully and offensively scented .Suffering from nausea without obtaining the relief permitted to a 94 HIS POINT OF VIEW man , the horse must overcome an intense disÂ ¬ like before he accepts our friendship . |

| source.excerpts.11.value | Considering that we were lost in sand - rock desert , all three of us owed our lives to that small distant smell .The more vivid perfume of cattle I have caught up easily at four - and - a - half miles on the wind , but by their conduct I think my horses had that savour some miles before it reached my duller senses .I think the scenting powers of a horse are about ten times as strong as mine . |

| source.excerpts.12.value | There is a more important lesson to be learned by practical study of wild range .The range has two types of herbage , the bunch grass and the thorned or aromatic bushes .The bunch grass is the staple food , the bushes a reserve in time of drought The use 6 4 THE TRAIL TO WATER of the reserve food has taught the horse to adapt his stomach to a change of diet . |
