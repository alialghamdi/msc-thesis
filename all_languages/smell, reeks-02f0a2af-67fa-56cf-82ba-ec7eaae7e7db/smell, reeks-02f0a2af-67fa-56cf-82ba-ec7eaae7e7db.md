| source.excerpts.4.value | Arthur Underwood in his " Notes on Ana ; thetics " says : " If an operation is roquire .l to bo prolonged beyond the limits of the brief inaen - sibility that can bo procured by Nitrous Oxide Gas , the agent usually employed to exteud the Anrosthesia is Etiier " Many authorities pass etlier and gas through the same face - piece ; but there is an objection to this practice , namely , the face - piece becomes so impregnated with ether that the whole apparatus reeks of it , and afterwards , when gas alone is passed through it , patients frequently complain of the smell and taste , and even in some cases of head - ache and miiluise " It is with the greatest possible diffidence , however , that I mention this objection , seeing that many administrators of the greatest experience and abilify adopt the com - bined method ." It is best in all cases to commence the administration with Nitrous Oxide ; by this means any unpleasanlness during the preliminary stages is avoided . |
