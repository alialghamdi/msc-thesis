| source.excerpts.1329.value | But at other times , when the immense distance is flooded by sunlight , showing up the sparkle of the river , and masses of wood mark the great places of the lords of the soil , while the cosy farm steadings steadings and the golden grain are visible in the valleys , and the abrupt declivities are full of finest colour , they are most beautiful ! Infinite space is the impression they give — freedom from all the small jars and troubles and worries our own conventionality heaps around us .Delight comes in the piny - scented air and the bruised bog - myrtle over which we tread ; and to anyone reared on highland soil , and whose associations and sympathies cleave to the soil , there is a subtle sense of being in harmony with the scene which enhances it all — the light of happy remembrance remembrance shines upon it , and makes it bright to us ; and the hopefulness which dwells in all rises again more powerfully than before .We renew our youth and look upon the future with a A March Violet . |
