| source.excerpts.2.value | The sky — so blue a moment ago — became mere darkness .The forked lightning lightning played about in every direction ; the thunder pealed as I suppose artillery does in a general engagement engagement ; we could smell , as it were , sulphur .It was all the work of a few moments , just like a change of scene upon the stage , and presently the hail came pelting down upon us in a way to cause pain . |

| source.excerpts.4.value | The inns — well , I think they are better than the average of inns in the French provinces , provinces , in some respects , and in some instances dirty enough ; but not worse than in Spain , in Italy - , or the south of France .In return for the very small amount of discomfort , what glorious scenes are opened before you ! I shall always look back to our ten days ' stay at Tlemcen ; and at Biskra on the edge of the desert , with its thousands upon thousands of palm trees ; and to the Chabet Pass , with the flowery show between it and Bougie ; and to stern , romantic Constantine ; and to Blidah , with its perfume perfume of orange groves ; and to Cherchel , with its ranges of aloes and remains of Rome ; and to our drives about the Metidja carpeted with brilliant wild flowers , and Fort National with the snow - covered Djudjura , and the Kabyle Highlands , as bright pages in a very bright chapter of my life .It is good to lay up a store of such recollections . |

| source.excerpts.5.value | You find this sort of thing both in French and Italian towns , and people come and go as though it existed not , until Death steps in and calls attention to the question by snatching away some notable personage .The French seem to regard the matter with calm indifference , and pass their lives in apparent security amidst bad odours which would drive an English family away from any place .Nay , in England itself , in our old country ! inns , our country houses , our sea - side lodgings , are we altogether immaculate immaculate ? Under the head of bad Algiers out of doors is just about the same thing as any ordinary French provincial town . |

| source.excerpts.8.value | The town of Algiers is drained , in a way — but in a very insufficient way .When rain comes , or , as here , drought followed by rain , the odours , both inside and outside the houses , indicate the presence of great pollution below .You find this sort of thing both in French and Italian towns , and people come and go as though it existed not , until Death steps in and calls attention to the question by snatching away some notable personage . |

| source.excerpts.9.value | It is not merely a spectacle for young ladies , it is not a mere pretext for airing your familiarity with long Latin names ; the whole country is splendid with colour .You may miss what is around me just now as I am jotting down my recollections of Algeria — the sober green tints of Sussex , the lordly oaks , the glossy beeches , the graceful Spanish chestnuts , the fragrant limes , towering above the fern , in the midst of which the dappled deer are pretending to be frightened , but are in reality displaying displaying their grace like young ladies tripping round a ball - room .These things have their charm , but they make up at best a sort of twilight banquet for the eyes ; just now I speak of Africa and golden I can only conclude , as I have often done before , with ■ and see it for So , driving up and down the hills , with very splendid views of Constantine and the neighbourhood around us we finally reach the Oasis of Salah Bey , with what Horace Walpole calls its its Bath , its Koubba , and its remains . |
