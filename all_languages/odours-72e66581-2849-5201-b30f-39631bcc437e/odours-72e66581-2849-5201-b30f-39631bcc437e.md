| source.excerpts.0.value | ~ 40 .Among the most decisive evidences of the d ^ ath of the foetus must be enumerated the very easy separation of the cuticle , and the escape of matter from the uterus having ' a cadaverous odour .When from the concurrence of evident causes with the ' more characteristic symptoms , practi - tioners agr - ee that death has taken place , some perplexity arises in determining whether the foetus should be extracted immediately , or whether the result of other means should be waited for . |

| source.excerpts.1.value | Flatulent external tumours in the scrotum , and in other parts of the body , have been acknowledged by most surgeons : and in the last illness of a girl whom the younger Du Verney saw , it is unquestionable that inflation had taken place , and it increased , with an undulating appearance , till , at length , it occupied the whole trunk of the ' body .When pressed , the sensation of air moving : away , w ith a kind of crackling noise , w as felt under tiio linger ; and as soon as the skiu of the abdomen 203 was cut through , an intolerable stench burst forth , and the whole tumefaction vanished .The difficulty which has been experienced in curing both species of tympanitis , is demonstrated by the remedy which even men of eminence have sanctioned , namely , paracentesis ; but , so far as I know , none of the more cautious surgeons have been found , who were willing to thrust a perforating instrument into the abdomen , without knowing i what parts he might wound . |

| source.excerpts.2.value | In other cases of ischuria renalis , as well as in retention of urine , I have already shown that this fluid has been excreted by the anus .Reusnerus relates , that on the seventh day of complete sup - pression , a child voided urine from the intestines , which ^ in colour , smell , and quantity , resembled that which is naturally excreted .It was not com - bined with any feculent matter , or attended with pain ; and it passed off about three or four times daily . |

| source.excerpts.3.value | Early in the morning he felt sick , but at first he was unable to excite vomiting even by irritating the fauces with his fingers : but he soon afterwards threw up four pints of fluid , similar to water in which chocolate had been dissolved .The odour of the fluid resembled that which usually exhales from the bodies of persons la ] ) Ouring under fever , and some portions of a membraniform substance floated in it , of the same colour as that of the fluid .Although the aflection of the stomach appeared to be somew hat IK 15 alleviated by this vomiting , yet the other symptoms not only continued , but even became more acute . |

I have observed the .same odour where there ha ^ been no fever , for instance , in a case of periodical headach , and in an instance of scabies . |

| source.excerpts.5.value | If these affections have any thing in common , the chief disorder is in the nervous system ; and I think it was with much propriety that Flemyng comprised affections of both species under the general appellation of Neuropathia .We are , therefore , not surprised when attacks of this description arise suddenly from terror , or indignation , or from peculiar odours .We may also understand the modus operandi of opium , in 479 preventing or arresting a paroxysm , when that narcotic has been opportunely administered : for though the orisrin of these attacks or paroxysms may seem traceable to the lower part of the abdo - men , the hypochondria , or uterus , yet the propaga - tion of noxious influence certainly was through the medium of the nerves and membranes . |

| source.excerpts.6.value | It seems evident , from the words of Scripture , that the practice of burning incense , among the Jews , was introduced with reference to the supposed salutary nature of the ex - halation .Immediately following the ordinance for its use , it is stated , that the time of burning it shall be at the dressing and lighting of the lamps ' ; when an offensive smell , thereby created , might probably have pervaded the temple .What - ever may have been the cause of its original introduction among the sacrifices , whether of the Jews or Heathens , its being appropriated to the service of the Temple long caused it to be held in superstitious veneration . |

| source.excerpts.7.value | â   The fragrant odour diffused in burning it is well known ; but its operation , as an enlivener of the spirits , in persons of weak health , does not seem to have been much regarded .Perhaps the pleasing antidote it affords to the effects of foul air in crowded assembly - rooms , may possibly hereafter give it a place among the luxuries of London and Paris .Hitherto the sacred Saban odour has been exclusively reserved for the religious ceremonies of the Greek and Roman churches ; and that which was once considered an offering worthy the altars of the Most High God , now scarcely ob - tains any notice . |

| source.excerpts.9.value | In a third portion of this viscus , towards the pylorus , the parietes were quite hard , and the pyloric orifice itself was so straitened that the chyme could scarcely be transmitted .Although the whole of this indurated part , when cut into , exhibited a white and solid texture , yet its inner surface , both in colour and fetor , resembled putrid flesh , diversified with some bloody points .Valsalva ^ xxix . |

| source.excerpts.10.value | In the person of his preceptor Natali , Malpighi found one of the ureters and the corresponding kidney sur - prisingly dilated , from the urine being intercepted by a calculus .The retention , which , in the end proved fatal , lasted many days , and the patient observed that his saliva had both the odour and flavour of urine ; and he perceived that the halitus transpiring through the skin , possessed the same urinous character .Albertini informed me that the noble youth , the structure of whose kidneys has been described by Malpighi in the letter to Sponius , not only spat saliva which had the taste and smell of urine , but the colour , as well as the flavour and odour , demonstrated that it was little else than urine . |

| source.excerpts.11.value | Dissection .From the mouth and nostrils a large quantity of fluid escaped , which had an mipleasant smell .The abdomen was as much tumefied as I recollect to have ever witnessed it in ascites , and when the cavity was opened , it was observed that this tumefaction was chiefly owing to the stomach and intestines being distended with flatus , and to the bulk of the uterus , which rose above the pelvic cavity . |

| source.excerpts.12.value | Of this we find an instance in Niebuhrâ   s Travels .â   * However much disposed to receive entertainment , they did not please us at first ; their vocal and instrumental music we thought horrible ; and their persons appeared disgustingly ugly , with their yellow hands , spotted faces , absurd ornaments , and hair larded with stinking pomatum .But by degrees we learned to endure them , and , for want of better , began to fancy some of them pretty , to imagine their voices agreeable , their movements graceful , though . |

| source.excerpts.13.value | During these fits , the pulse often continues in its natural state ; but , in some persons , the fits are attended with a frequency of pulse , and with some heat and thirst , as marks of some degree of fever .If urine be voided at the beginning of a fit , it is commonly in considerable quantity , and with little colour or odour ; but , after the fit is over , the urine voided is in the ordinary quantity , of a high colour , and sometimes deposites a sediment .In some persons , du - ring the fit , the face is a little flushed and turgid ; but more commonly it is somewhat pale and shrunk . |
