And thou mak ' st , all sweet as fair , One Arabia of the air — That around thee broods and sighs If in far Arabia lies The soul of odour full and deep That in bliss the sense doth steep ! Did they fable forth of old A Flora of celestial mould ? — 112 And if once more I might inhale That air which tells to me a tale Of hopes as fresh , and dreams as fair As ev ' n itself — that chrystal air .And if once more I might but hear The old familiar music dear Of those sweet streams — so blue , so bright , That gush like floods of liquid light — Once more I might become a child In thought — and feeling — free and wild My heart a world — with visions rife , A vision to itself — my Life ! I might take up Fate ' s tangled thread , Where first with fibres black and dread ' Twas mixed — to endanger and enchain , And weave the mystic web again ! 401 And would ' st thou have me unto thee reveal Why this reluctance of distrust I feel — Must I to thee the hidden truth unfold ? Ah ! better far to mask it and withhold ! Yet , since thou will ' st it — let me own to thee Why thus I tremble at thy love for me , To thee the painful truth with candour tell , It is because I love thee — but too well ! Because too well — too well I love thee still — And fain would spare thee every earthly ill ; And know I not that loving me must call On thy devoted head Earth ' s miseries all ? Ah ? know I not that loving me must bring To thy devoted heart each keenest sting , Each deadliest dart of suffering and of pain — And clasp round thee my harsh and heavy chain , d i & gt ; 90 A SPRING EVENING . |

Oh transport to the view , ' Tis the violet bursting through ! Pause ! — feel ' st thou the velvet sod ? Soft as ever fairies trod ; Mark — is not that odorous breath Wafted from Spring ' s new - pleached wreath ? Oh ! thou brightest season smile O ' er field and rock and mount and isle , O ' er Earth and air , o ' er sea and shore — For the ocean ' s purple floor Wins a more enchanting hue , A deeper and diviner blue , 183 What mattered it to me since I believed , Since I was utterly and all deceived .Oh ! let me be again deceived and blest , Force back the Falsehood , and restore the rest ! The lost delights revive — the dream renew , The false we trust is truer than the true — For while it lasts ' tis all indeed our own , Our Soul its element — our heart its throne ! The outward World ' s cold breath there may not come , The mind enspheres it in a Star - like home .In our existence it exists — derives Its food from our strong fancy — while it lives The Life of living souls — intense , supreme — And what hath truth to give worth such a Dream ? Yes ! while it lasts it is ourselves — and we Must doubt our life ere its Reality ! And oh ! ' tis real ! ' tis truer than the true ! Our own Possession and Creation too ! But let us wake not — close the willing eye — Dream — dream and be deceived — dream on — and die ! 474 Even these worst pangs of fevered pain That shot like fire through breast and brain , And racked me with a restless fear , I felt as Life itself were dear . |

What oderiferous treasure in thee lies — How redolent thy rich and fragrant sighs — What wealth ambrosial hast thou not amassed , Full long secreted and imprisoned fast — Thus — thus our hearts in stern affliction ' s hour Give out unto that grasp of iron power 432 A glad tumult of murmurs , through copse and flowered shade Speaks of life and of joy — all undimmed — undecayed — And , melody - fraught , shakes each leaf of the glade , Like a faint moaning shell of the Sea .Where the orange - bowers all their fair treasures unfold , Till the grove hath a Star - light of red burning gold ! Where in beautiful gloom stand the lone fanes of old , The fanes of the glorious dead ! Where thrillingly low , sing the echo - voiced doves , Till music — the awakener ! — ruffles the groves — May blessings fall round ye ! sweet Land of the Loves ! May blessings around ye be shed ! Yet is nothing but Beauty — and Beauty in bloom , In that young world of Sunshine and flowers and perfume , Ah ! the Cypress grows there , as awaiting the tomr In darkness and silence it towers ! 495 FIREFLIES AT MILAN .Bright lovely things , Like Stars on wings , Ye daze the eye Thus flashing by . |

Nor then heeded the sigh of the wind echoing long — Ah ! I heard not the sigh — overborne by the song ! The sweet song of the birds in their freedom and bliss .But that time was the deepest of contrasts to this ! Now , the Sun may shine out in crowned splendour and pride , If one faint wreath of cloud be dim - frowning beside — I mark that — but am blind to the Sun heav ' nly bright — Still I dream of the darkness , nor look for the light ! Now the birds may exult in as brilliant a strain , If there be a low sound that seems still to complain , Ev ' n the slight shivery breath of the shrill moaning breeze Dying — dying away ' mongst the unechoing trees , That sound is the sound that / hear , full and strong , Since I watch for the wail , and still shrink from the song .Oh ! that sound is the sound that o ' er me winneth sway , For I mind but the moan , and I list not the lay . |

| source.excerpts.6.value | There are hours in this Life — calm and happy and holy , Which seem all to themselves — and set sweetly apart — Free from Memory ' s fond fever — and Hope ' s fatal folly — Like a lovely Eternity lent to the Heart ! 20 The Conqueror ' s spoils , the Merchant ' s splendid boast , The Altar ' s ornament , of boundless cost ; But though thus hidden , and embedded deep , Within the bowels of the earth they sleep , And ask man ' s laboured care and patient toil To clear them from the close - embracing soil , To free them from the dust and dross , because ' Tis one of Heaven ' s profound and sapient laws That Difficulty still should of Success Remain the strict Condition , and no less , The life and soul of its enjoyment , too , Still robing it with charms for ever new ; Enhancing still its pleasure and its pride , ( And lending it delights — alone supplied By that keen glow of feeling , which they share Who conscious of their own proud conquests are , Who know that they , with strong and steadfast aim , The stubborn obstacles at length o ' ercame ; And who can say , with high and honest pride , I thrust the obstructions and the bars aside , 466 What fearful pangs shall pierce that lovely mind , So tenderly and faultlessly refined ? How shall thine own deep feelings darkly grow The truest source of suffering and of woe ? And all thy fair endowments , all thy powers But make more torturing those long wasting hours Of heart - sick cold suspense , or blighting fear , Or pale despair that cannot shed a tear , Till even thy richest gifts shall seem to be The heaviest portion Fate hath stored for thee , ' Twas thoughts like these , that crowded on my mind When first I saw thee artless yet refined , Gentle but stately in thy lofty grace , With all thy Soul of Beauty in thy face , I trembled for thee then and turned away , Lest that I might those mournful thoughts betray — I trembled for thee then — I tremble now ! But to recall that bright and beaming brow , That kindled earnest eye too much inspired , With rays too ardent and too restless fired — 281 Sweet leaves decayed That long since made The green wood fair , Free fluttering there , And myriad things On chainless wings , As glad as thou Art surely now — Thy little life With transports rife Shall soon in peace Untroubled cease , And thou shalt be A Phantasy — Aye ! thou shalt seem Ev ' n so a dream Of memory Fair thing to me — If ever thought Of thee be brought 23 Behold ! the glories everywhere outspread , Beneath Man ' s wandering foot — above his head In rich succession exquisite and bright , To arrest the fancy and attract the sight , Fair treasures Heaven doth evermore dispense To charm his yearning soul , and chain his sense ! Behold the diamond dewdrops of the morn , Which every leaf and every spray adorn , Myriads and myriad myriads — twinkling thick With ceaseless scintillation , clear and quick , Fair as the richest diamonds of the mine , With countless colours they intensely shine , And make the rainbow - earth itself appear One precious jewel — beautiful and clear — While each pure drop , ere its brief race be run , Holds up its fairy mirror to the Sun ! Behold the painted pageants of the skies , That shine with matchless and with nameless dyes , And win the astonished and enchanted gaze With the Orient splendours of their varied blaze ; 431 THE ISLE OF BEAUTY .Where glitters the Isle where the sunny tract glows , All baptized by the odours that drop from the rose , Where in Paradise - breathings the Southern - Wind blows So rich is the Soul of its sighs ! Where laughs the sweet Isle that is washed by the wave , O ' er whose silvery tremour no storm dares to rave , The olden Venus ' bright haunt ! the lost Sun - God ' s warm grave , Like some Star fallen away from the Skies ! Lit up by the purple Heaven ' s mightiest of rays — Yet tender the radiance , and softened the blaze ! Oh ! precious its nights are — and beauteous its days ! Love — Love ! — ' tis a realm meet for thee .152 When where ' er we turn , where ' er we move , e ' en universally around , A sadness dwells upon the air , the sky , the shadowy ground — We seem unto a host of griefs to unlock the accordant heart , In the sorrows of the sorrowing Earth we feel we bear our part . |

But thou , Oh ! stern and frozen North , Hast thou no glory and no worth ? Have thy far frowning regions wide No beauties of severer pride ? Hast thou no wonders to display , No mighty and sublime array ? Aye ! verily , Old North ! thou hast , And o ' er thine outstretched icy waste ' Twere marvellous to mark the sway Of lengthened night or lingering day , While spreads the frozen World beneath , As though it knew no life , nor breath . |
