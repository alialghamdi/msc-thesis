In honour of my host , I had donned a black frockcoat frockcoat ; and as the temperature was about eighty , my sufferings were great ; but in the East , a cut - away coat is indecorous ; and my linen suits unfortunately were made in the usual shooting - coat shape .After some half - hour ' s ride through tortuous and evil - smelling lanes , by mosques and through bazaars , in and out of repair , we came to the large mud - plastered portico of Mirza M Khan ' s house .At the door was a sentry , who saluted . |
