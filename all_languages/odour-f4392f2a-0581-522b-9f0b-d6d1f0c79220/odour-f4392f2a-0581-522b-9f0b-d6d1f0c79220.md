| source.excerpts.283.value | Where the country round a very large cover is open , and a hunted Fox runs to it , the Fox least likely to break is that which the hounds are hunt - ing , he will be unwilling to quit the cover , unless he can get a great distance before the hounds , : in finding at such a cover , and to procure a run over such a champaign country , a skilful person should be posted tp halloo a Fox off , and lay the hounds on to him , the further he is before them , the less likely will he be to return to the cover ; the best method , however , to hunt a cover like this , and to get good chases from it , is to stick constantly to it , and not suffer the hounds to break , so long as one Fox remains in it ; let this be done two or three hunting days following , and Foxes will then readily fly from it .In heathy countries amidst many roads , Foxes will always run these roads in dry weather ; when hounds over - run the scent , the Huntsman should return with them to the first cross road , and there they will probably recover it .In large covers , where there are several roads , in bad scenting days when these roads are dry , or after a Thaw when they carry . |

| source.excerpts.611.value | As we decidedly object to square beds for any description of flowers that are placed in ornaÂ ¬ mental gardens , we recommend that circular holes should be dug out and filled with the proper earth or compost raised somewhat above the level of the border , and that from five to seven plants should be placed in a star shape , at about six or nine inches apart , which will eventually appear as one large plant , and give a much finer effect than a large straggling plant ; for the largest and most bushy plants do not produce the finest flowers , for they naturally put forth numerous but small stems , which one root is not able to support so as to produce a number of fine large c FLORA HISTORIC A .46 flowers , and when young plants are placed singly on the borders , there is not sufficient show of blossoms to render them attractive or to afford sufficient fragrance , added to which it is less trouble to make a few holes to receive the proÂ ¬ per compost , than to give it separately to each plant ; and as the blue colour of the grass leaves of the Pink is very ornamental in the winter months by its contrast with the colour of the grass lawn , or the foliage of those plants which retain their leaves , it is desirable to form the clumps of sufficient size to give effect , always bearing in mind that the Pink loves an open siÂ ¬ tuation , and a pure air , with a south - east aspect .Clumps of Pinks would appear to great adÂ ¬ vantage if formed immediately on grass lawns , but in this case they must be planted sufficiently thick to hide the earth , but until their growth is formed moss of any kind may be strewed over the vacant space , which can be removed as the Pinks increase in size . |

| source.excerpts.833.value | To a Sportsman it is needless to observe , that scent depends on the state of the weather , and is effected by its vicissitudes ; a storm will in an instant destroy it , nor is this to be wondered at , if we consider these particles of scent are of an exactly equal specific gravity with those of the Air , and which always fall and rise in just proportion to it .Huntsmen who are hasty , rate and curse those hounds ( which yes - terday were the best in England , ) for galloping with their noses in the air , as if their game was flown , when in fact it is in vain for them to seek the scent in any other place , the increasing weight of that fluid Element , having wafted it over their heads .The most terrible day for the Hare is , when the Air is in its mean gravity , tolerably moist , but inclining to grow drier , with a mild breeze ; the moderate gravity buoys up the scent as high as the dogâ   s breast , the vesicles of moisture serve as canals to carry the effluvia into their noses , and the gentle wind so much helps to spread it , that every hound , even at eight or ten paces distance , especially with the wind , may have a due portion . |
