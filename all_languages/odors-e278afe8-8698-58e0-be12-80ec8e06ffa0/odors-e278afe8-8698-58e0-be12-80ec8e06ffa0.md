| source.excerpts.0.value | It was dirtier than any battle - field he had seen , harder to contemplate than any actual hardship moulded of mire and sweat and danger , it was an atmosphere wherein birth and marriage and death were loathsome , secret things .He remembered one day in the subway when a delivery boy had brought in a great funeral wreath of fresh flowers , how the smell of it had suddenly cleared the air and given every one in the car a momentary glow ." I detest poor people , " thought Amory suddenly . |

| source.excerpts.1.value | There were so many places where one might deteriorate pleasantly : Port Said , Shanghai , parts of Turkestan , Constantinople , the South Seas — all lands of sad , haunting music and many odors , where lust could be a mode and expression of life , where the shades of night skies and sunsets would seem to reflect only moods of passion : the colors of lips and poppies .STILL WEEDING Once he had been miraculously able to scent evil as a horse detects a broken bridge at night , but the man with the queer feet in Phoebe ' s room had diminished to the aura over Jill .His instinct perceived the fetidness of poverty , but no longer ferreted out the deeper evils in pride and sensuality . |

| source.excerpts.2.value | Afterward he walked through the dull ache of a setting sun when even the clouds seemed bleeding and at twilight he came to a graveyard .There was a dusky , dreamy smell of flowers and the ghost of a new moon in the sky and shadows everywhere .On an impulse he considered trying to open the door of a rusty iron vault built into the side of a hill ; a vault washed clean and covered with late - blooming , weepy watery - blue flowers that might have grown from dead eyes , sticky to the touch with a sickening odor . |

| source.excerpts.4.value | Far ahead a black dot showed itself , resolved slowly into a human shape .But Amory was beyond that now ; he turned off the street and darted into an alley , narrow and dark and smelling of old rottenness .He twisted down a long , sinuous blackness , where the moonlight was shut away except for tiny glints and patches . |

| source.excerpts.5.value | He was dressed at half past , so he sat down by the window ; felt that the sinews of his heart were twisted somewhat more than he had thought .What an ironic mockery the morning seemed ! — bright and sunny , and full of the smell of the garden ; hearing Mrs .Borge ' s voice in the sun - parlor below , he wondered where was Isabelle . |

| source.excerpts.8.value | He pictured himself in an adobe house in Mexico , half - reclining on a rug - covered couch , his slender , artistic fingers closed on a cigarette while he listened to guitars strumming melancholy undertones to an age - old dirge of Castile and an olive - skinned , carmine - lipped girl caressed his hair .Here he might live a strange litany , delivered from right and wrong and from the hound of heaven and from every God ( except the exotic Mexican one who was pretty slack himself and rather addicted to Oriental scents ) — delivered from success and hope and poverty into that long chute of indulgence which led , after all , only to the artificial lake of death .There were so many places where one might deteriorate pleasantly : Port Said , Shanghai , parts of Turkestan , Constantinople , the South Seas — all lands of sad , haunting music and many odors , where lust could be a mode and expression of life , where the shades of night skies and sunsets would seem to reflect only moods of passion : the colors of lips and poppies . |

| source.excerpts.9.value | He thought how much easier patriotism had been to a homogeneous race , how much easier it would have been to fight as the Colonies fought , or as the Confederacy fought .And he did no sleeping that night , but listened to the aliens guffaw and snore while they filled the car with the heavy scent of latest America .In Princeton every one bantered in public and told themselves privately that their deaths at least would be heroic . |

| source.excerpts.13.value | He found it impossible to study conic sections ; something in their calm and tantalizing respectability breathing defiantly through Mr .Rooney ' s fetid parlors distorted their equations into insoluble anagrams .He made a last night ' s effort with the proverbial wet towel , and then blissfully took the exam , wondering unhappily why all the color and ambition of the spring before had faded out . |

| source.excerpts.15.value | He found himself reading the same paragraphs over and over , so he abandoned this attempt and leaning over wearily pressed his hot forehead against the damp window - pane .The car , a smoker , was hot and stuffy with most of the smells of the state ' s alien population ; he opened a window and shivered against the cloud of fog that drifted in over him .The two hours ' ride were like days , and he nearly cried aloud with joy when the towers of Princeton loomed up beside him and the yellow squares of light filtered through the blue rain . |

| source.excerpts.17.value | He stood aside , edged a little into the rain to let the throng pass .A small boy rushed out , sniffed in the damp , fresh air and turned up the collar of his coat ; came three or four couples in a great hurry ; came a further scattering of people whose eyes as they emerged glanced invariably , first at the wet street , then at the rain - filled air , finally at the dismal sky ; last a dense , strolling mass that depressed him with its heavy odor compounded of the tobacco smell of the men and the fetid sensuousness of stale powder on women .After the thick crowd came another scattering ; a stray half - dozen ; a man on crutches ; finally the rattling bang of folding seats inside announced that the ushers were at work . |

| source.excerpts.19.value | Every night the gymnasium echoed as platoon after platoon swept over the floor and shuffled out the basket - ball markings .When Amory went to Washington the next week - end he caught some of the spirit of crisis which changed to repulsion in the Pullman car coming back , for the berths across from him were occupied by stinking aliens — Greeks , he guessed , or Russians .He thought how much easier patriotism had been to a homogeneous race , how much easier it would have been to fight as the Colonies fought , or as the Confederacy fought . |

| source.excerpts.20.value | One night they walked while the moon rose and poured a great burden of glory over the garden until it seemed fairyland with Amory and Eleanor , dim phantasmal shapes , expressing eternal beauty in curious elfin love moods .Then they turned out of the moonlight into the trellised darkness of a vine - hung pagoda , where there were scents so plaintive as to be nearly musical ." Light a match , " she whispered . |

| source.excerpts.21.value | The rain gave Amory a feeling of detachment , and the numerous unpleasant aspects of city life without money occurred to him in threatening procession .There was the ghastly , stinking crush of the subway — the car cards thrusting themselves at one , leering out like dull bores who grab your arm with another story ; the querulous worry as to whether some one isn ' t leaning on you ; a man deciding not to give his seat to a woman , hating her for it ; the woman hating him for not doing it ; at worst a squalid phantasmagoria of breath , and old cloth on human bodies and the smells of the food men ate — at best just people — too hot or too cold , tired , worried .He pictured the rooms where these people lived — where the patterns of the blistered wall - papers were heavy reiterated sunflowers on green and yellow backgrounds , where there were tin bathtubs and gloomy hallways and verdureless , unnamable spaces in back of the buildings ; where even love dressed as seduction — a sordid murder around the corner , illicit motherhood in the flat above . |

| source.excerpts.24.value | The minutes passed and Amory sat there very quietly .He regretted the rule that would forbid freshmen to be outdoors after curfew , for he wanted to ramble through the shadowy scented lanes , where Witherspoon brooded like a dark mother over Whig and Clio , her Attic children , where the black Gothic snake of Little curled down to Cuyler and Patton , these in turn flinging the mystery out over the placid slope rolling to the lake .Princeton of the daytime filtered slowly into his consciousness — West and Reunion , redolent of the sixties , Seventy - nine Hall , brick - red and arrogant , Upper and Lower Pyne , aristocratic Elizabethan ladies not quite content to live among shopkeepers , and , topping all , climbing with clear blue aspiration , the great dreaming spires of Holder and Cleveland towers . |
