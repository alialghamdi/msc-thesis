The site of our encampment was well chosen ; it was a small sloping lawn , the verdure fresh , and skirted on three sides with trees ; the fourth bounded by the deep bed of a torrent - river .At proper distances on this lawn , there were five large and commodious tents , pitched in a semicircle : that in which we all assembled , and passed the sultry part ofthe day , was carpeted , and by means of the tattees of aromatic grass , continually watered , kept at a temperature pretty near to that of an April day in England .Here we had a luxurious cold dinner , - with a variety of excellent excellent wines , and other liquors , well cooled ; and while we dined , the French - horns and clarionets played marches , hunting - pieces descriptive of the death of the game , and other slow movements ; the tigers still lying in front , and the people still assembled , but retired to a greater distance ; where they anxiously wTaited the signal for skinning and cutting up the slain ; for with them the fat of a tiger is a panacea , the tongue dried and pulverized a sovereign specific in nervous cases , and every part applicable to some use ; even the 456 TELLICHERRY . |

Such was despotism two thousand years ago , such it continues at this present day ! That absolute power hardens the heart , in whatever climate or country it is permitted , cannot be doubted . |
