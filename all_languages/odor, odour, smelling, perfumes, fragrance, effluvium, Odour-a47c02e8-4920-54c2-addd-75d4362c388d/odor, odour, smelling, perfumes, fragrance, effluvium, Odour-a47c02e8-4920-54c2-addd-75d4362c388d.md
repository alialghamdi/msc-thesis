| source.excerpts.519.value | It is , on the other hand supposed , that combustion is equivalent to destruction , while in effect , it only changes pre - existing combinations by new ones , and sometimes it forms compound substances of those that are simple , which , in reality , is rather to produce than to destroy .Pure oxygen air is confined to the pur - pose of exciting the powers of suspended animation , and it is , therefore , to be admi - nistered to children born apparently dead or overlaid ; to persons suffocated by drown - ing , by steam of charcoal , by foul air , & c , whenever the circumstances of the case , may indicate the possibility of recovery .Dr Crawford , however , is of opinion , " that the fluids which destroy fetid odours most speedily , are those which are acknow - ledged to contain the greater portion of 130 oxygen , and that it is therefore extremely probable that this change depends on the union of the oxygen with animal hepatic gas , or some one of its constituent parts . |

| source.excerpts.773.value | In Arabia , a bitter and a sweet sort were formerly distinguished ; and in comÂ ¬ merce three kinds are occasionally found , derived either from the amomum , the costus , or the Alpinia of Linnaeus .i The root of costus is recommended a9 stoma - cnic , diaphoretic , and diuretic ; it impregnates the urine with a violet smell .On evaporating a decocÂ ¬ tion of this root , almost all its smell is dissipated ; but a bitter extract is obtained nearly equalling two thirds of the root . |

Anatomists say that rooks , by reason of two large nerves which run down between the 142 NATURAL HISTORY eyes into the upper mandible , have a more delicate feeling in their beaks than other round - billed birds , and can grope for their meat when out of sight .Perhaps then their associates attend them on the motive of interest , as greyhounds wait on the motions of their finders ; and as lions are said to do on the yelpings of jackals . |

| source.excerpts.3389.value | The addition of a tincture has likewise the effect of preserving decoctions and infusions from spontaneous decomposition , the compound tincture of Cardamoms answers such an object in the compound decoction of Aloes .Tinctures are sometimes made with aether , but they are generally more strongly characterised by the nature of the menstruum than by that of the substance dissolved in it ; indeed , aether is used in these cases , not to dissolve substances which would resist the acÂ ¬ tion of alcohol and water , but for the sake of its own direct action on the body ; thus the Edinburgh pharÂ ¬ macopoeia directs an AEthereal Tincture of Aloes , which is more penetrating and stimulant than the alcoÂ ¬ holic tinctures ; the London College , with the excepÂ ¬ tion of the Aromatic Spirit of AEther ^ does not recogÂ ¬ nise any preparation of this nature : I have already alÂ ¬ luded to the AEthereal Tincture of Digitalis of the French Codex , than which nothing can be more injuÂ ¬ dicious , for the digitalis does not amount to more than l - 70th part of the tincture , and must therefore be entirely counteracted by the stimulant effects of the menstruum .The same objection cannot be urged against the aetliereal tinctures of Castor , Musk , and Amber , since in these cases , the subject and the menÂ ¬ struum concur in their mode of operation . |
