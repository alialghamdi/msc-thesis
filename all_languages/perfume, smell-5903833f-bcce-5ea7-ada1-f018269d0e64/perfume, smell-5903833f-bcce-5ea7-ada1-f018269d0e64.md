| source.excerpts.13.value | Any disturbance , a ray of light as well as an electric current , or a mechanical concussion , will produce sensations of light on the optic nerve , and sensations of sound in the auditory nerve .The same causes will produce sensations of smell in the olfactory nerve , and sensations of touch or of temperature in the sensory nerves that terminate in the skin .* The feehng which originates in the ganghon , dur - ing the transmission of a nervous perturbation , can depend upon the forms only of the different cells . |
