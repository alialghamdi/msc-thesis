| source.excerpts.1.value | Essential oils have been classified by Omeltschenko , according to their bactericidal power , as follows : â   Cinnamon , fennel , lavender , eloves , thyme , mint , anise , eucalyptus , turpen - tine , lemon and rose , the last two being very weak as compared with the others .The work done in this direction requires confirmation , but the results so far obtained , go far to prove that there was something in the notions which prevailed long ago with regard to the preventive and remedial powers of odorous plants and their products .In 1753 , Pibrac introduced a simple method of dressing wounds , after an operation , which he de - scribes as follows : â   The sides of the wound should be brought together with bandages , and I put others of finer quality on the wound , dipped in a mixture of plain water and brandy , in which I had beaten up the whites of eggs . |
