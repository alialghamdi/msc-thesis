| source.excerpts.4.value | The place is crowded with people all the time , and as the gay - colored Eastern fabrics are lavishly displayed before every shop , the great Bazaar of Stamboul is one of the sights that are worth seeing .It is full of life , and stir , and business , dirt , beggars , asses , yelling peddlers , porters , dervishes , high - born Turkish female shoppers , Greeks , and weird - looking and weirdly dressed Mohammedans from the mountains and the far provinces — and the only solitary thing one does not smell when he is in the Great Bazaar , is something which smells good .CHAPTER XX . |

| source.excerpts.7.value | Other Arabs were filling black hog - skins with water — skins which , well filled , and distended with water till the short legs projected painfully out of the proper line , looked like the corpses of hogs bloated by drowning .Here was a grand Oriental picture which I had worshiped a thousand times in soft , rich steel engravings ! But in the engraving there was no desolation ; no dirt ; no rags ; no fleas ; no ugly features ; no sore eyes ; no feasting flies ; no besotted ignorance in the countenances ; no raw places on the donkeys ’ backs ; no disagreeable jabbering in unknown tongues ; no stench of camels ; no suggestion that a couple of tons of powder placed under the party and touched off would heighten the effect and give to the scene a genuine interest and a charm which it would always be pleasant to recall , even though a man lived a thousand years .Oriental scenes look best in steel engravings . |

| source.excerpts.10.value | No , the water did not blister us ; it did not cover us with a slimy ooze and confer upon us an atrocious fragrance ; it was not very slimy ; and I could not discover that we smelt really any worse than we have always smelt since we have been in Palestine .It was only a different kind of smell , but not conspicuous on that account , because we have a great deal of variety in that respect .We didn ’ t smell , there on the Jordan , the same as we do in Jerusalem ; and we don ’ t smell in Jerusalem just as we did in Nazareth , or Tiberias , or Cesarea Philippi , or any of those other ruinous ancient towns in Galilee . |

| source.excerpts.11.value | For me was reserved the high honor of discovering among the rubbish of the ruined Coliseum the only playbill of that establishment now extant .There was a suggestive smell of mint - drops about it still , a corner of it had evidently been chewed , and on the margin , in choice Latin , these words were written in a delicate female hand : “ Meet me on the Tarpeian Rock tomorrow evening , dear , at sharp seven .Mother will be absent on a visit to her friends in the Sabine Hills . |

| source.excerpts.12.value | It was a very solemn place .I expected that the spiced odors of Araby were going to steal over my senses now , but they did not .A copper - colored skeleton , with a rag around him , brought me a glass decanter of water , with a lighted tobacco pipe in the top of it , and a pliant stem a yard long , with a brass mouth - piece to it . |

| source.excerpts.13.value | Here and there a strong red , green , or blue glare from a rocket that was struggling to get away , splendidly illuminated all the boats around it .Every gondola that swam by us , with its crescents and pyramids and circles of colored lamps hung aloft , and lighting up the faces of the young and the sweet - scented and lovely below , was a picture ; and the reflections of those lights , so long , so slender , so numberless , so many - colored and so distorted and wrinkled by the waves , was a picture likewise , and one that was enchantingly beautiful .Many and many a party of young ladies and gentlemen had their state gondolas handsomely decorated , and ate supper on board , bringing their swallow - tailed , white - cravatted varlets to wait upon them , and having their tables tricked out as if for a bridal supper . |

| source.excerpts.14.value | My face smarted for a couple of hours , but it was partly because I got it badly sun - burned while I was bathing , and staid in so long that it became plastered over with salt .No , the water did not blister us ; it did not cover us with a slimy ooze and confer upon us an atrocious fragrance ; it was not very slimy ; and I could not discover that we smelt really any worse than we have always smelt since we have been in Palestine .It was only a different kind of smell , but not conspicuous on that account , because we have a great deal of variety in that respect . |

| source.excerpts.15.value | So long as its waters remain to it away out there in the midst of that howling desert , so long will Damascus live to bless the sight of the tired and thirsty wayfarer .“ Though old as history itself , thou art fresh as the breath of spring , blooming as thine own rose - bud , and fragrant as thine own orange flower , O Damascus , pearl of the East ! ” Damascus dates back anterior to the days of Abraham , and is the oldest city in the world .It was founded by Uz , the grandson of Noah . |

| source.excerpts.17.value | The poor old sheik we saw at Cesarea Philippi with his ragged band of a hundred followers , would have been called a “ king ” in those ancient times .It is seven in the morning , and as we are in the country , the grass ought to be sparkling with dew , the flowers enriching the air with their fragrance , and the birds singing in the trees .But alas , there is no dew here , nor flowers , nor birds , nor trees . |

| source.excerpts.18.value | For years and years I have dreamed of the wonders of the Turkish bath ; for years and years I have promised myself that I would yet enjoy one .Many and many a time , in fancy , I have lain in the marble bath , and breathed the slumbrous fragrance of Eastern spices that filled the air ; then passed through a weird and complicated system of pulling and hauling , and drenching and scrubbing , by a gang of naked savages who loomed vast and vaguely through the steaming mists , like demons ; then rested for a while on a divan fit for a king ; then passed through another complex ordeal , and one more fearful than the first ; and , finally , swathed in soft fabrics , been conveyed to a princely saloon and laid on a bed of eider down , where eunuchs , gorgeous of costume , fanned me while I drowsed and dreamed , or contentedly gazed at the rich hangings of the apartment , the soft carpets , the sumptuous furniture , the pictures , and drank delicious coffee , smoked the soothing narghili , and dropped , at the last , into tranquil repose , lulled by sensuous odors from unseen censers , by the gentle influence of the narghili ’ s Persian tobacco , and by the music of fountains that counterfeited the pattering of summer rain .That was the picture , just as I got it from incendiary books of travel . |

| source.excerpts.19.value | This Civita Vecchia is the finest nest of dirt , vermin and ignorance we have found yet , except that African perdition they call Tangier , which is just like it .The people here live in alleys two yards wide , which have a smell about them which is peculiar but not entertaining .It is well the alleys are not wider , because they hold as much smell now as a person can stand , and of course , if they were wider they would hold more , and then the people would die . |

| source.excerpts.20.value | No one could have imagined the park was not real .We even thought we smelled the flowers at first .We got a carriage at twilight and drove in the shaded avenues with the other nobility , and after dinner we took wine and ices in a fine garden with the great public . |

| source.excerpts.21.value | It is thoroughly Syrian , and that is to say that it is thoroughly ugly , and cramped , squalid , uncomfortable , and filthy — just the style of cities that have adorned the country since Adam ’ s time , as all writers have labored hard to prove , and have succeeded .The streets of Magdala are any where from three to six feet wide , and reeking with uncleanliness .The houses are from five to seven feet high , and all built upon one arbitrary plan — the ungraceful form of a dry - goods box . |

| source.excerpts.22.value | Of all the unchristian beverages that ever passed my lips , Turkish coffee is the worst .The cup is small , it is smeared with grounds ; the coffee is black , thick , unsavory of smell , and execrable in taste .The bottom of the cup has a muddy sediment in it half an inch deep . |

| source.excerpts.23.value | In the park are rustic seats , here and there , in secluded nooks that are dark with shade ; there are rivulets of crystal water ; there are lakelets , with inviting , grassy banks ; there are glimpses of sparkling cascades through openings in the wilderness of foliage ; there are streams of clear water gushing from mimic knots on the trunks of forest trees ; there are miniature marble temples perched upon gray old crags ; there are airy lookouts whence one may gaze upon a broad expanse of landscape and ocean .The palace is modeled after the choicest forms of Grecian architecture , and its wide colonnades surround a central court that is banked with rare flowers that fill the place with their fragrance , and in their midst springs a fountain that cools the summer air , and may possibly breed mosquitoes , but I do not think it does .The Grand Duke and his Duchess came out , and the presentation ceremonies were as simple as they had been at the Emperor ’ s . |

| source.excerpts.24.value | Some of us bathed for more than an hour , and then came out coated with salt till we shone like icicles .We scrubbed it off with a coarse towel and rode off with a splendid brand - new smell , though it was one which was not any more disagreeable than those we have been for several weeks enjoying .It was the variegated villainy and novelty of it that charmed us . |

| source.excerpts.25.value | Its waters are very clear , and it has a pebbly bottom and is shallow for some distance out from the shores .It yields quantities of asphaltum ; fragments of it lie all about its banks ; this stuff gives the place something of an unpleasant smell .All our reading had taught us to expect that the first plunge into the Dead Sea would be attended with distressing results — our bodies would feel as if they were suddenly pierced by millions of red - hot needles ; the dreadful smarting would continue for hours ; we might even look to be blistered from head to foot , and suffer miserably for many days . |

| source.excerpts.27.value | What next ? Can it be possible that the painters make John the Baptist a Spaniard in Madrid and an Irishman in Dublin ? We took an open barouche and drove two miles out of Milan to “ see ze echo , ” as the guide expressed it .The road was smooth , it was bordered by trees , fields , and grassy meadows , and the soft air was filled with the odor of flowers .Troops of picturesque peasant girls , coming from work , hooted at us , shouted at us , made all manner of game of us , and entirely delighted me . |

| source.excerpts.31.value | When the work of the day is done , they forget it .Some of them go , with wife and children , to a beer hall and sit quietly and genteelly drinking a mug or two of ale and listening to music ; others walk the streets , others drive in the avenues ; others assemble in the great ornamental squares in the early evening to enjoy the sight and the fragrance of flowers and to hear the military bands play — no European city being without its fine military music at eventide ; and yet others of the populace sit in the open air in front of the refreshment houses and eat ices and drink mild beverages that could not harm a child .They go to bed moderately early , and sleep well . |

| source.excerpts.32.value | The people here live in alleys two yards wide , which have a smell about them which is peculiar but not entertaining .It is well the alleys are not wider , because they hold as much smell now as a person can stand , and of course , if they were wider they would hold more , and then the people would die .These alleys are paved with stone , and carpeted with deceased cats , and decayed rags , and decomposed vegetable - tops , and remnants of old boots , all soaked with dish - water , and the people sit around on stools and enjoy it . |

| source.excerpts.35.value | It is just like any other Oriental city .That is to say , its Moslem houses are heavy and dark , and as comfortless as so many tombs ; its streets are crooked , rudely and roughly paved , and as narrow as an ordinary staircase ; the streets uniformly carry a man to any other place than the one he wants to go to , and surprise him by landing him in the most unexpected localities ; business is chiefly carried on in great covered bazaars , celled like a honeycomb with innumerable shops no larger than a common closet , and the whole hive cut up into a maze of alleys about wide enough to accommodate a laden camel , and well calculated to confuse a stranger and eventually lose him ; every where there is dirt , every where there are fleas , every where there are lean , broken - hearted dogs ; every alley is thronged with people ; wherever you look , your eye rests upon a wild masquerade of extravagant costumes ; the workshops are all open to the streets , and the workmen visible ; all manner of sounds assail the ear , and over them all rings out the muezzin ’ s cry from some tall minaret , calling the faithful vagabonds to prayer ; and superior to the call to prayer , the noises in the streets , the interest of the costumes — superior to every thing , and claiming the bulk of attention first , last , and all the time — is a combination of Mohammedan stenches , to which the smell of even a Chinese quarter would be as pleasant as the roasting odors of the fatted calf to the nostrils of the returning Prodigal .Such is Oriental luxury — such is Oriental splendor ! We read about it all our days , but we comprehend it not until we see it . |

| source.excerpts.36.value | The place is crowded with people all the time , and as the gay - colored Eastern fabrics are lavishly displayed before every shop , the great Bazaar of Stamboul is one of the sights that are worth seeing .It is full of life , and stir , and business , dirt , beggars , asses , yelling peddlers , porters , dervishes , high - born Turkish female shoppers , Greeks , and weird - looking and weirdly dressed Mohammedans from the mountains and the far provinces — and the only solitary thing one does not smell when he is in the Great Bazaar , is something which smells good .CHAPTER XXXIII . |

| source.excerpts.37.value | Presently a smoke rose about our feet — a smoke that smelled of all the dead things of earth , of all the putrefaction and corruption imaginable .We were there five minutes , and when we got out it was hard to tell which of us carried the vilest fragrance .These miserable outcasts called that “ fumigating ” us , and the term was a tame one indeed . |
