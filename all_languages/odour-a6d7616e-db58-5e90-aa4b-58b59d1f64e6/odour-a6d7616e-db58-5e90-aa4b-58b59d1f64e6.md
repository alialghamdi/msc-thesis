| source.excerpts.5.value | " Among animals we see great diversities in this sense .Whilst none possess the refined taste of man , there are many , which are capable , by taste or smell , of knowing those plants , that are nutritive , from those that are noxious to them ; and it is very unusual for us to find that an animal has died from eating those which are unquestiona - ble poisonous to it .Yet , as we have remarked , a substance , which is noxious to one , may be eaten with impunity by another : and , if we select animals , and place them in a field , containing plants , all of which are ranked by us as poisons , and which are poisonous to a ma - jority of those animals , we find that not only has a selection been made by each animal of that which is innocuous to it , but that the substance has furnished nourishment to it , whilst to the other it would have proved fatal . |

| source.excerpts.26.value | In the latter , he can have recourse to a variety of means for distinguishing the properties of bodies , and hence he has less occasion for acuteness of smell than in the former ; whilst , again , in the civilized state , numbers destroy the sense , in older to procure pleasure .The use of snuff is one of the most common of these destructive influences .Of the acuteness of the sense of smell in the savage , we have an example , on the authority of Humboldt : he afffrms , that the Peru - vian Indians in the middle of the night , can distinguish the different races by their smell , â   whether they are European , American Indian , or negro . |

| source.excerpts.27.value | It was long maintained , as in the case of savours , that odours are dependent upon a peculiar principle , which , according to its particu - lar combination with the constituents of bodies , gives rise to the various odours .To this principle the terms aroma , and spiritus rector have often been assigned ; but the notion has been long aban - doned , because no general or common characters were observable amongst odorous bodies , as ought to be expected , were they in - debted for their odour to the same principle ; and because , again , bodies can be deprived of their odour by exposing them to ap - propriate agents , as when we subject them to infusion and distil - lation .Walther , a German physiologist , is of opinion , that an odorous body is only such by virtue of a vibratory motion , analogous to that made by a sonorous body . |

| source.excerpts.86.value | From these experiments , he considered himself justified in infer - ring , that the olfactory nerve does not preside over the general sensibility of the nose ; that it has , at the most , but a special sensi - bility as concerns odours ; and that if the olfactory nerve be the nerve of smell , it at least requires the influence of the fifth pair , in order that it may act : lastly , he asks , may not the general and spe - cial sensibility be comprised in the same nerve in the sense of smell , as they are in that of taste ; â   in the fifth pair ? These experiments are highly interesting ; but they do not entirely establish , that the fifth pair is the olfactory nerve .The numerous facts , already mentioned , attract us irresistibly to the first pair , or olfactory , as they have been exclusively called .It has been already remarked , that the fifth is concerned in all the facial senses ; that it conveys to them general sensibility , or feeling ; and that some of them are unquestionably supplied with nerves of special sensibility ; â   the eye , for example , with the optic nerve , and the ear with the auditory ; but that neither one nor the other can exert its special function , without the integrity â   the presidency â   of the fifth pair . |

| source.excerpts.230.value | Yet , to preserve the senses in the vigour and delicacy , which they are capable of acquiring by attention , the impressions must not be too constantly or too strongly made .The occasional use of the sense of smell , under the guidance of volition , may be the test on which the chemist , or the perfumer , or the wine - merchant , may rely in the discrimination of the nume - rous odorous characteristics of bodies ; but , if the olfactory nerves be constantly or too frequently stimulated by excitants of this or any other kind , dependence can no longer be placed upon that means of discrimination .The maxim , that " habit blunts feeling , " is true only in such cases as the last . |

These experiments are highly interesting ; but they do not entirely establish , that the fifth pair is the olfactory nerve . |

| source.excerpts.233.value | The food always became putrid , but sooner , when the juice employed was not acid ; and , if it sometimes liquefied , before becoming putrid , this was attributed to the acidity of the juice , as the same effect took place , when saliva , mixed with a little vinegar , was employed .Montegre , moreover , observed , that the food , rejected from the stomach , was longer in becoming putrid , in proportion to the time it had been subjected to the chymifying action of the stomach ; and he concluded , that the fluid , which is sometimes contained in the stomach when empty , instead of being a menstruum kept in reserve for chymification , is nothing more than the saliva , continually sent down into that viscus , and that its purity or acidity depends upon the chymifying action of the stomach .As l ' egards the fluid , met with in the stomach of fasting animals , Montegre ' s remarks may be true in the main ; but we have too many evidences in favour of the chymical action of some secretion from the stomach during digestion to permit us to doubt for a moment of the fact . |
