looking in the interior : they give similar results on analysis and are probably largely , though not entirely , of one kind , the botanical source of which it has not been possible to determine .As these resins are of a date before mummification and also before the use of resin for varnish or as an adhesive or for making into personal ornaments and other objects , 1 except occasional small beads which have been found from predynastic times , 2 the most likely use seems to have been as incense , more particularly as there is no evidence that frankincense and myrrh were known before the dynastic period .","fragrant","smell","These resins","http://data.odeuropa.eu/actor/3b8303a7-be34-5f71-97d4-c0051395c0ed","A. . n 91079980 Lucas","Ancient Egyptian materials & industries","http://archive.org/details/b29828739","1934","en","http://data.odeuropa.eu/vocabulary/olfactory-objects/269","Incense","http://data.odeuropa.eu/vocabulary/olfactory-objects/558","Fragrance / Cosmetic","http://data.odeuropa.eu/time/1a6b4621-d61b-5733-ba62-ea4f0b4e349e","1934","1934","1934","https://sws.geonames.org/360986/","Madīnat an Nikhāb","http://data.odeuropa.eu/source/2b48bade-d9b8-51e6-8825-f39f0337c8f7/fragment/cb32ede8-b763-5524-bf29-752b9d986eac"
