| source.excerpts.32.value | de Not all the accounts of the wonderful properties of the Dead Sea , however , which found their way into the legends and traditions , are to be rejected ; for it may with good reason be supposed , that in the course of time the physical character of the sea has changed ; and that just as the springs at Tiberias are evidently widely different from what they were two thousand years ago , so the Dead Sea may have been equally transformed .Edrisi , 1 for example , tells us that in his time the water of this lake was hot , and sent forth an offensive odour ; and this may indeed have been the case , for the sulphureous gas which Lynch mentions may not then have arisen from springs as now , but may have been thrown into the sea first .And we have the authority of the American explorer for believing that there is hot mud at the southern extremity of the sea . |
