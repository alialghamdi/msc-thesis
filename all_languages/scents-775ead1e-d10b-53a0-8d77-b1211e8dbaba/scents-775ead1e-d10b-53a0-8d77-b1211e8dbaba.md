| source.excerpts.0.value | My eye reaches to the stars ; my ears to the thunder in the sky , or to the vibrating vocal chords of the lark which sings there .My nose goes into the petals of the rose by continuity of the perfume which exhales from them ; or into the joint which gives out its appetising smell in the roasting .My taste reaches into the textures brought into contact with it as the touch continues on beyond its immediate self in the tension of a cord or the extension of a rod . |

| source.excerpts.1.value | These organs are those of hearing , sight , and smell , and all are in such immediate relations with the brain that the walls of the cavities which contain them form an integral part of the basis cranii .These three organs of the superior senses , regarded in the period of their first forma - tion , are only annexes of the encephalon ; the external ear proceeds from the posterior cerebral cavity ; the eye is merely a diverticular of the anterior cerebral cell ; and the olfactory nerve can only be considered as a vesicular prolongation of this very anterior cell .Directly associated with the develop - ment of the brain , and contained in cavities which are merely annexes of the basis cranii , the organs of hearing , sight , and smell form a perfectly natural group , which descends forwardly as far as the nasal spine , as the partition between the nasal fossa ? depends on the ethmoid which belongs to the skull . |

| source.excerpts.8.value | And although the hoped - for gains of this collective investigation movement may not be such as to admit of being labelled and placed on the shelves of a museum , they will serve to throw a new light on what is already placed there , and will at least help us to a better knowledge and practice of our profession .You will admit that a migraine headache ; an attack of asthma from the smell or sight of some particular object ; the troubles of digestion from mental work and anxiety ; the special liabilities to disease of certain families , and the cloud of small ailments which often make life intolerable , though having no morbid anatomy , deserve a more exact study than they have yet obtained , whether for the satis - faction of the intellect , or for the latent pathological mean - ing they may convey to us ; and especially , further , that when we have learned to question nature we find she has much more to tell us , even on trifles , than we had expected .The idea of a collective investigation of diseases , in which every member of the medical body shall have his effective part , though obviously not to be realised at once , not indeed until the sun of science , which is the true Apollo of Medicine , has risen far higher in our sky than now , is yet one that at once challenges our ready and best efforts for its realisation . |
