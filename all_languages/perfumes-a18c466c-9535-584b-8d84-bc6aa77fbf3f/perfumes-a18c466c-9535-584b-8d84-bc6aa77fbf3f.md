| source.excerpts.0.value | An ebony couch having feet shaped as those of a leopard and enriched with gleaming bronze , having the skins of leopards cast across it , and , upon the skins , silken soft cushions wrought in patterns of green and gold , stood upon the mosaic floor at the head of three shallow steps which descended to a pool where a fountain played , softly musical ; wherein lurked gleaming shapes of silver and gold .Bright mats were strewn around , and at one comer of the pool a huge silver mibkharah sent up its pencilings of aromatic smoke .Upon this couch Shahmarah reclined , and I perceived immediately that her reputation for beauty was richly deserved . |

| source.excerpts.1.value | I shaved and went to the bath , and repaired to the shop of Ahzab .My brother ' s steward was not there , whereat I rejoiced , and arrayed myself in the most splendid suit that I could find , and having perfumed myself with essences and sweet scents , I summoned a boy and said : " Go thou and bring here a porter .Order him to carry yon large chest to the house of the Walî , near the Mosque of Ibn - Mizheh , and ask for the lady Jullanar who hath purchased this box and a number of things which are in it . |

| source.excerpts.2.value | That Abû Tabâh possessed a sort of uncanny power akin to second sight I knew , but I regarded it merely as a form of telepathy .His presence at the preparation of the secret perfume did not surprise me , for a belief in the efficacy of magical operations prevailed , as I was aware , even among the more cultured Moslems .My scepticism , however , was about to be rudely shaken . |

| source.excerpts.3.value | Some two hundred and forty feet of labored , descent discovered me in a sort of shallow cavern little more than a yard high and partly hewn out of the living rock which formed the foundation of the pyramid .In this place I found the heat to be almost insufferable , and the smell of remote mortality which assailed my nostrils from the sand - strewn floor threatened to choke me .For five minutes or more I lay there , bathed in perspiration , my nerves at high tension , listening for the slightest sound within or without . |

| source.excerpts.4.value | Well might he watch with tolerant smile the more showy activities of his less fortunate competitors .The shop of Mohammed er - Rahmân was at the end of the street remote from the Hamzâwi ( Cloth Bazaar ) , and as I stood up to resume my labors my mood of gloomy abstraction was changed as much by a certain atmosphere of expectancy — I cannot otherwise describe it — as by the familiar smells of the place .I had taken no more than three paces onward into the Sûk ere it seemed to me that all business had suddenly become suspended ; only the Western element of the throng remained outside whatever influence had claimed the Orientals . |

| source.excerpts.5.value | After a time my troubled spirit grew calmer , as I sat there inhaling the insidious breath of Tonquin musk , the fragrance of attár of roses , the sweetness of Indian spikenard and the stinging pungency of myrrh , opoponax , and ihlang - ylang .Faintly I could detect the perfume which I have always counted the most exquisite of all save one — that delightful preparation of Jasmine peculiarly Egyptian .But the mystic breath of frankincense and erotic fumes of ambergris alike left me unmoved ; for amid these odors , through which it has always seemed to me that that of cedar runs thematically , I sought in vain for any hint of " Breath of Allah . |

| source.excerpts.6.value | For whilst I could no longer hear his voice , I now could see the words issuing from his mouth ! They formed slowly and gracefully in the blue clouds of vapour some four feet above his head , revealed their meaning to me in letters of gold , and then faded away towards the ceiling ! Old - established beliefs began to totter about me as I became aware of a number of small murmuring voices within the room .They were the voices of the perfumes burning in the brazier .Said one , in a guttural tone : " I am Myrrh . |

| source.excerpts.7.value | I determined to approach from the left , where I should be able to take advantage of the far - cast shadows of the palm groves and of the direction of the faint breeze ; for most of all I feared the dogs , without which no Arab village is complete .Sure enough , although I had elected to approach the left of the village and although I crawled laboriously upon hands and knees , the accursed brutes apparently scented me or heard me and made night hideous with their clamor .Flat upon the ground I lay , awaiting the dogs who bore down upon me snarling , their fangs bared . |

| source.excerpts.8.value | " Yet , " she said softly , " he hath the look of an active young man ." " His activity , " replied the scent merchant , " resideth entirely in his tongue ." The Lady Zuleyka seated herself upon the dîwan , looking all about the apartment . |

| source.excerpts.9.value | There was little danger in the maneuver , provided I made no noise ; for the hanging lamp , by reason of its form , cast no light into the upper part of the room .As I achieved the desired position I became painfully aware of the pungency of the perfume with which the apartment was filled .Lying there upon the ledge in a most painful attitude , I wriggled forward inch by inch further into the room , until I was in a position to use my right arm more or less freely . |

| source.excerpts.10.value | Then , a swift revelation , the truth burst in upon my mind .He was there in the capacity of imám and attendant magician at the mystical " Blessing of the perfumes " ! With cautious tread I retraced my steps , circled round the Mosque and made for the narrow street which runs parallel with that of the Perfumers and into which I knew the courtyard beside Mohammed ' s shop must open .What I did not know was how I was going to enter it from that end . |

| source.excerpts.11.value | For this reason I have always resented the way in which the Moslem veils the faces of the pearls of his harêm .And whilst the success of my present enterprise would not render the Lady Zuleyka the poorer , it would enrich and beautify the world by delighting the senses of men with a perfume more exquisite than any hitherto known .Such were my reflections as I made my way through the dark and deserted bazaar quarter , following the Shâria el - Akkadi to the Mosque of el - Ashraf . |

| source.excerpts.12.value | We crossed this place , my heel taps echoing hollowly and before a curtained door took pause .An impressive interval of perfumed silence ; then in response to the muffled clapping of hands , the curtain was raised and I was thrust into a smaller apartment beyond .I found myself standing before a long dîwan , amid an opulence of Oriental appointment which surpassed anything which I could have imagined . |

| source.excerpts.13.value | It was empty .The lamp was lighted , as I had observed from below , and a faint aroma of Turkish tobacco smoke hung in the air .Clearly , Bréton had left but a few moments earlier ; and I judged it probable that he would be returning very shortly , for had he set out for Shepheard ' s he would not have left his door unlocked , and in any event I should have met him on the way . |

| source.excerpts.14.value | The plaster of the walls — the place apparently was built of a mixture of straw and dried mud — provided residence not only for mosquitoes , but also for ants , and the entire building was redolent of an odor suggestive of dried bones .That smell of dried bones is characteristic , I have learned , of the sites of ancient Egyptian cities ( Zagazig is close to the ruins of ancient Bubastis , of course ) ; one gets it in the temples and the pyramids , also .But it was novel to me , then , and not pleasing . |

| source.excerpts.15.value | I was a prisoner ; and , in the same instant that I realized the fact of my incarceration , I realized also that I had been duped .The weird happenings in the apartment of Mohammed er - Rahmân had been hallucinations due to my having inhaled the fumes of some preparation of hashish , or Indian hemp .The characteristic sickly odor of the drug had been concealed by the pungency of the other and more odoriferous perfumes ; and because of the position of the censer containing the burning hashish , no one else in the room had been affected by its vapor . |

| source.excerpts.16.value | then my antagonist introduced gouging , and I had to beat the mat .It had been a stiff bout , and the stinking shambles were whirling about me like a bloody maelstrom .When things settled down a bit , I found myself lying in a small cell skewered up like a pullet , and with a prospect of iron grating and stone - flagged passage before me . |

| source.excerpts.17.value | Despite the gloom of the place and the yashmak which she wore , it was manifest that she was good to look upon .A faint but exquisite perfume stole to my nostrils , whereby I knew that Mohammed ' s charming visitor was none other than , the Lady Zuleyka ." Yet , " she said softly , " he hath the look of an active young man . |

| source.excerpts.18.value | Sense of smell I had none ; but a chuckling , demoniacal voice spoke from the mibkharah , saying — " I am Hashish ! I drive men mad ! Whilst thou hast lain up there like a very fool , I have sent my vapors to thy brain and stolen thy senses from thee .It was for this purpose that I was set here beneath the window where thou couldst not fail to enjoy the full benefit of my poisonous perfume .. |

| source.excerpts.19.value | At about four o ' clock in the afternoon came the dawn of a hazy idea , and since it necessitated a visit to my rooms at Shepheard ' s , I washed the paint off my face and hands , changed , hurried to the hotel , ate a hasty meal , and returned to the Darb el - Ahmar , where I resumed my disguise .There are some who have criticized me harshly in regard to my commercial activities at this time , and none of my affairs has provoked greater acerbitude than that of the perfume called " Breath of Allah ." Yet I am at a loss to perceive wherein my perfidy lay ; for my outlook is sufficiently socialistic to cause me to regard with displeasure the conserving by an individual of something which , without loss to himself , might reasonably be shared by the community . |

| source.excerpts.20.value | An examination of my rooms by candle - light revealed the presence of a cupboard , or what I thought to be a cupboard , but opening the double doors I saw that it was a window , latticed and overlooking a lower apartment ; so much I perceived by the light of an oil lamp which stood upon the table .Then , stifling a gasp of amazement , I hastily snuffed my candle and peered down eagerly at that incredible scene .. |

| source.excerpts.21.value | I set at naught my fears at trusting my father ' s favorite son within the walls of the Walî ' s house .I thought only of Jullanar of the slender waist and heavy hips , of the dewy lips , more intoxicating than wine , and the eyes of my beloved like wells of temptation to swallow up the souls of men .I shaved and went to the bath , and repaired to the shop of Ahzab . |

| source.excerpts.22.value | The wealthiest man with whom I was acquainted in the Muski had the aspect of a mendicant ; and whilst Mohammed ' s neighbors sold phials of essence and tiny boxes of pastilles to the patrons of Messrs .Cook , were not the silent caravans following the ancient desert routes laden with great crates of sweet merchandise from the manufactory at Shubra ? To the city of Mecca alone Mohammed sent annually perfumes to the value of two thousand pounds sterling ; he manufactured three kinds of incense exclusively for the royal house of Persia ; and his wares were known from Alexandria to Kashmîr , and prized alike in Stambûl and Tartary .Well might he watch with tolerant smile the more showy activities of his less fortunate competitors . |

| source.excerpts.24.value | I pondered deeply over these matters .The scheme was a good one and could not fail to reap considerable profits ; for , given extensive advertising , there is always a large and monied public for a new smell .The particular blend of liquid fragrance to which the letter referred was assured of a good sale at a high price , not alone in Egypt , but throughout the capitals of the world , provided it could be put upon the market ; but the proposition of manufacture was beset with extraordinary difficulties . |

" " No apology is necessary , " I assured him ." Had I returned direct to Shepheard ' s I should have arrived too early for luncheon ; and the odor of garlic , which informed the sack that your zeal for duty caused to be clapped upon my head , is one for which I have a certain penchant if it does not amount to a passion ." Abu Tabah smiled , inclined his head again , and slightly raising the ebony cane indicated my pinioned wrists , at the same time glancing at the negro . |

| source.excerpts.27.value | After that I knew where I could find them up to any time before lunch ; I knew they were safe enough for the rest of the morning ; and accepting my defeat at the hands of the jewel merchant who turned his slow eyes upon me and shrugged apologetically , I drifted off , after a decent interval ( leaving young Forrest , who , mysteriously , had turned up , to do the cavalierly ) , intending to visit my acquaintance , Hassan , in the Sûk el - Attârin ( Street of the Perfumers ) , not twenty yards away .You know Hassan ? A large , mysterious figure in the shadows of his little shop , smoking amber - scented cigarettes as though he liked them , and turning his sleepy eyes slowly upon each passer - by .Well , I drifted around in his direction . |

| source.excerpts.29.value | This damsel was riding upon a mule with a richly embroidered saddle , with stirrups of gold , and she was covered with an izar of exquisite fabric ; and about her slender waist was a girdle of gold - embroidered silk .I was stricken speechless with the beauty and elegance of her form ; and when she alighted and came into the shop , the odors of sweet perfumes were diffused from her , and she captivated my reason by her loveliness .Seating herself beside me , she raised her izar , and I beheld her black eyes . |

But lo ! beneath my uncomely garments , I am Ahzab , thy lover ! " III As a man who sleeps ill after a protracted feast , I heard her answer , saying : " Is it true thou hast come to me , or is this a dream ? " " Verily , it is true ! " answered the accursed , the vile , the unspeakable Ahzab , my brother — for it was he ." From the time when I first saw thee , neither sleep hath been sweet to me , nor hath wine possessed the slightest flavor ! I have come to thee thus , fragrant bloom of the pomegranate , because I would not have thee see me in a posture so undignified as that of one crouched in a box ! So that thy people might be compelled to give me access to thine apartments , I have put a mendicant in my place , rendering the chest heavy ! " And she said , " Thou art welcome ! " and embraced him .By Allah ( whose name be exalted ) , I gnawed my beard until I choked ! " Thou art changed , beloved ! " she said to him ; " thou art always beautiful , but to - day thou seemest less rosy - cheeked to mine eyes ! " The accursed Ahzab , like an enraged mule , kicked the box wherein I dissolved in flames of wrath . |
