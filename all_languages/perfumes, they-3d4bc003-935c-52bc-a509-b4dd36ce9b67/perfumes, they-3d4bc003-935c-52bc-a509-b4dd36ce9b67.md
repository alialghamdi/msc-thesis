| source.excerpts.1.value | The corolla is the exÂ ¬ terior envelope of the flower , investing the central parts , but invested by the calyx ; the corolla , therefore , never exists unless when there is a double perianth of which it forms the interior part .It is generally of a finer and more delicate texture than the calyx , and is of all the parts of fructification the most showy and ornamental , being always , or with few exceptions , that which is the most highly coloured ; hence commonly regarded as alone constituting the flower as well as that from which the flower imparts its rich perfume , delighting at the same time both the Â « , stamens ; ft , pistil ; c , glume ; d , d , lepiceue .these sight and the smell . |

| source.excerpts.5.value | Not only the roots , but every other part of the plant of white hellebore , is acrid and poisonous , and is shunned by most animals .The dried root has no peculiar smell , but a nauseous , acrid , and bitter taste .When applied to open sores and ulcers , it produces its purging effect ; and if snuffed up the nose , gives rise to violent sneezÂ ¬ ing . |

| source.excerpts.6.value | Dr Clarke , in the sixth volume of his travels , mentions having been regaled with this delicacy by the English consul , at the island of Syros , and he bears testimony to its excellence .This plant is considerably larger than the common sage of our gardens , and its flavour and smell are much more powerful .It grows very abunÂ ¬ dantly in Candia , Syros , and Crete , where it attains to the size of a small shrub . |

| source.excerpts.7.value | Every part of it abounds with resinous juice ; even the leaves are full of transparent resinous points , like those of the orange tree .The balÂ ¬ sam , as brought to this country , is commonly of the consistence of thin honey , of a reddish brown colour , inclining to black ; an agreeable aromatic smell , and a very hot , biting taste .It is said to be obtained by boiling the cuttings of the twigs in water , and skimming off with a spoon the balsam which swims on the top . |

| source.excerpts.10.value | The bark , however , is more intensely bitter than the wood , and seems the most powerful as a mediÂ ¬ cine .Quassia has no sensible odour , its taste is that of a pure bitter , more intense and durable than that of any other known substance .It imparts this bitter to water more completely than to alcohol , or any other liquid ; and the infusion is not blackened by any of the salts of iron . |

| source.excerpts.12.value | The leaves are the medicinal parts of the plant .They have little smell , but a bitter , nauseous taste .In large doses they produce the usual effects of a poisonous narcotic , as vomiting , purging , dimness of sight , giddiness , and delirium , followed by death ; in moderate and regulated doses , their medicinal effects are : to diminish the frequency of the pulse , and the irritability of the system ; to increase the action of the absorÂ ¬ bents , and the action of the urinary organs . |

| source.excerpts.13.value | The branches , which lie so thick together , safe and well protected under their scaly leaves , soon begin to be developed , and are drawn out until the whole plant , with its numerous thread - like leaves , assumes very much the character of a larch tree , having its miniature parts more light and eleÂ ¬ gant , and the colour of a more lively green .The flowers , which wave in graceful panicles , are of a yellow hue , and of a fragrant smell .They are followed by round berries of a bright orange - red . |

| source.excerpts.15.value | ing candles ; and hence an explication of this singular phenomenon observable in the pictam - niis fraxinella .This plant is fragrant , and the odour which it diffuses around forms a partial and temporary atmosphere , which is inflammal ) le ; for if a lighted candle or other ignited body is brought near to the plant , especially in the time of drouglits , its atmosphere immediately takes fire .This phenomenon was first observed by the daughter of the celebrated Linnaeus , and is explained by supposing the partial and temporÂ ¬ ary atmosphere to contain a portion of wax exÂ ¬ uded from the plants , and afterwards reduced to vapour by the action of the sun . |

| source.excerpts.16.value | No vegetable production of the colder latitudes , or which can be ripened in those latitudes without the assistÂ ¬ ance of artificial heat , is at all comparable with the strawberry in point of flavour ; and if the soil and situation be properly adapted to it , the more cold the climate , indeed the more bleak and elevated , the more delicious is the berry .The fine aroma of the strawberry is not quite so evanescent as that of the raspberry ; but it is by no means durable ; and the berries can be had in absolute perfection only when taken from the plants , and in dry weather , for a very slight shower will render the strawberry comparatively flavourless .The soils and situations in which the strawberry and the raspberry come to the greatest perfection are the very opposites of each other . |

| source.excerpts.18.value | It does not seem to have been knowm to the Greeks , but was much used by the Arabian phyÂ ¬ sicians , and called cafur or canfur .Its odour is disagreeable , and destroys insects and vermin ; and it is on this account used in museums .From its great volatility , however , it soon evaÂ ¬ porates , unless confined in close boxes or bottles . |

| source.excerpts.19.value | Its bitter taste is accompanied by an aromatic flavour , but not sufficient to prevent its being disagreeÂ ¬ able .The smell is not very iinjdeasant , and sometimes resembles that of myrrh .The hepatic aloes are chiefly brought from Barbadoes ; the best sort in large gourd shells , the inferior kind in pots , and a still worse in casks ; it is of a darker colour , and not so clear as the other . |

| source.excerpts.20.value | Let us now proceed to take a more general view of the productions of those glowing regions .These productions are not only more numerous , but more splendid in their colours , more fragrant , more pungent in their taste , and more varied in their forms than the plants of other climates .â   When a traveller newly arrived from Europe , penetrates for the first time into the forests of South America , if he is strongly susceptible of the beauty of picturesque scenery , he can scarcely , â   says Humboldt , â   define the various emotions which crowd upon his mind ; he can scarcely distinguish what most excites his adÂ ¬ miration , â   the deep silence of these solitudes , the individual beauty and contrast of forms , or that vigour and freshness of vegetable life which characterises the climate of the tropics . |

| source.excerpts.21.value | Some are devoid of stem , or have an herbaceous or half shrubby stem ; the leaves are simple , pinÂ ¬ nate , or decompound in the stemless kinds ; or entire , toothed , lobed , or pubescent in the shrubby species ; and generally odorous , especially when pressed between the fingers .In the majority of geraniums the flowers are odourless , especially those of the more showy kinds ; while some of the simpler , and more unpretending blossoms , diffuse a grateful odour , especially during night .The most beautiful flowering geraniums , or pelargoniums , as they are sometimes called , are hybrids , which have been obtained by crossing different species , as first practised by Sweet . |

| source.excerpts.22.value | The fruit is almost the size of the head of an artichoke , scaly , and of a greenÂ ¬ ish yellow colour .The rind is strong and thick ; but the pulp is delicious , having the odour of rose - water , and tasting like clotted cream mixed with sugar .It is , like many other fruits , said to have a much finer flavour in the Indian ArÂ ¬ chipelago than in the West Indies . |

| source.excerpts.23.value | Caraway ( carutn carui ) .The caraway is a biennial aromatic plant , a native of England , and still found growing wild occasionally in meadows and pastures .This plant is cultivated for its seeds chiefly , which are of a pleasing aromatic flavour , and are used in confectionary and someÂ ¬ times in medicine . |

| source.excerpts.24.value | It imparts to water in which it has been infused , a deep , yellow colour , a slight odour , and balsamic taste ; by distillation it gives out more of its fragrance , but does not yield an essential oil .The spiritÂ ¬ uous solution gently distilled off from the filtered , reddish liquor , brings over with it very little of the fragrance of the storax , while the remaining resin is more fragrant than the finest storax in the tear .The pure resin distilled without addiÂ ¬ tion yields , along with an empyreumatic oil , a portion of benzoic acid , similar to the flowers of benzoin . |

| source.excerpts.25.value | The bruised leaves emit an odour somewhat like that of tobacco .This odour is still stronger when the leaves are burnt , and on ignition they sparkle with a crackling noise , somewhat like the deflagration of nitre .To the taste the leaves are mild and mucilaÂ ¬ ginous . |

| source.excerpts.26.value | The roots have been long medicinally employed , and were formerly imported here from Asia and the Levant ; but those of English growth are now very generally substituted , and found to be little or nothing inferior to the exotic sort , which is merely a variety of the same species .The root , in its dried state , has a moderately strong aromatic smell , and a warm , pungent , bitter , taste .Water completely extracts this bitter principle , and rectified spirit that of the aroÂ ¬ matic . |

| source.excerpts.27.value | Rectified spirit also extracts , and in some degree conceals , the odour of this oil ; and the bitter taste of the tincture is stronger than that of the watery infusion .These flowers possess the tonic and stomachic qualities usually ascribed to simple bitters , havÂ ¬ ing very little astringency , but a strong odour of the aromatic and penetrating kind ; hence they are also of a stimulating nature , and in some degree allay nervous irritability .They were formerly much used in the cure of interÂ ¬ mittent and other similar fevers , and have in some instances been substituted for tlie Peruvian bark . |

| source.excerpts.28.value | It is allied to the melastomaceae , which differ from it in the very remarkable and constant disposition of the nerves of their leaves , and in the number and structure of their stamina ; to the onagrariae , which differ in having their staÂ ¬ mens determinate ; to the rosaceae , which are distinguished by their alternate leaves and mulÂ ¬ tiple styles ; and to the combretaceae , in which the lobes of the embryo are convolute .These plants generally contain a pungent or fragrant volatile oil , together with tannin and gallic acid .Cloves are the flowers of caryoÂ ¬ phyllus aromaticus . |
