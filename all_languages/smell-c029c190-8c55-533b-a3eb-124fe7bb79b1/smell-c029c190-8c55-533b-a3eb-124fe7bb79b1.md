| source.excerpts.0.value | It is thoroughly Syrian , and that is to say that it is thoroughly ugly , and cramped , squalid , uncomfortable , and filthy — just the style of cities that have adorned the country since Adam ' s time , as all writers have laboured hard to prove , and have succeeded .The streets of Magdala are anywhere from three to six feet wide , and reeking with uncleanliness .The houses are from five to seven feet high , and all built upon one arbitrary plan — the ungraceful form of a drygoods drygoods box . |

| source.excerpts.2.value | It is just like any other Oriental city .That is to say , its Moslem houses are heavy and dark , and as comfortless as so many tombs ; its streets are crooked , rudely and roughly paved , and as narrow as an ordinary staircase ; the streets uniformly uniformly carry a man to any other place than the one he wants to go to , and surprise him by landing him in the most unexpected localities ; business is chiefly carried on in great covered bazaars , celled like a honeycomb with innumerable shops no larger than a common closet , and the whole hive cut up into a maze of alleys about wide enough to accommodate a laden camel , and well calculated to confuse a stranger , and eventually lose him ; everywhere everywhere there is dirt , everywhere there are fleas , everywhere everywhere there are lean , broken - hearted dogs ; every alley is thronged with people ; wherever you look your eye rests upon a wild masquerade of extravagant costumes ; the workshops are all open to the streets , and the workmen visible ; all manner of sounds assail the ear , and over them all rings out the muezzin ' s cry from some tall minaret , minaret , calling the faithful vagabonds to prayer ; and superior to the call to prayer , the noises in the streets , the interest of the costumes — superior to everything , and claiming the bulk of attention first , last , and all the time — is a combination combination of Mohammedan stenches , to which the smell of even a Chinese quarter would be as pleasant as the roasting roasting odours of the fatted calf to the nostrils of the returning returning Prodigal .Such is Oriental luxury — such is Oriental splendour ! We read about it all our days , but we comprehend it not until we see it . |

| source.excerpts.3.value | In the park are rustic seats , here and there , in secluded nooks that are dark with shade ; there are rivulets of crystal water ; there are lakelets , with inviting , inviting , grassy banks ; there are glimpses of sparkling cascades cascades through openings in the wilderness of foliage ; there are streams of clear water gushing from mimic knots on the trunks of forest trees ; there are minute marble temples perched upon grey old crags ; there are airy look - outs whence one may gaze upon a broad expanse of landscape and ocean .The palace is modelled after the choicest forms of Grecian architecture , and its wide colonnades surround a central court that is banked with rare flowers that fill the place with their fragrance , and in their midst springs a fountain that cools the summer air , and may possibly breed mosquitoes , but I do not think it does .The Grand Duke and his Duchess came out , and the presentation ceremonies were as simple as they had been at the Emperor ' s . |

| source.excerpts.4.value | Other Arabs were filling black hog - skins with water — skins which , well filled , and distended with water till the short legs projected painfully painfully out of the proper line , looked like the corpses of hogs bloated by drowning .Here was a grand Oriental picture which I had worshipped a thousand times in soft , rich , steel engravings ! But in the engraving there was no desolation ; no dirt ; no rags ; no fleas ; no ugly features ; no sore eyes ; no feasting flies ; no besotted ignorance in the countenances ; no raw places on the donkeys ' backs ; no disagreeable jabbering in unknown tongues ; no stench of camels ; no suggestion that a couple of tons of powder placed under the party and touched off would heighten the effect and give to the scene a genuine interest and a charm THE ORIENTAL KISS .171 which it would always be pleasant to recall , even though a man lived a thousand years . |

| source.excerpts.7.value | My face smarted for a couple of hours , but it was partly because I got it badly sun - burned while I was bathing , and stayed in so long that it became plastered over with salt .No , the water did not blister us ; it did not cover us with a slimy ooze and confer upon us an atrocious fragrance ; it was not very slimy ; and I could not discover that we smelt really any worse than we have always smelt since we have been in Palestine .It was only a different kind of smell , but not conspicuous on that account , because we have a great deal of variety in that respect . |

| source.excerpts.10.value | The cadaverous , half nude varlets that served in the establishment had nothing of poetry in their appearance , nothing of romance , nothing of Oriental splendour .They shed no entrancing odours — just the contrary .Their hungry eyes and their lank forms continually suggested one glaring , unsentimental fact — they wanted what they term in California square I went into one of the racks and undressed . |
