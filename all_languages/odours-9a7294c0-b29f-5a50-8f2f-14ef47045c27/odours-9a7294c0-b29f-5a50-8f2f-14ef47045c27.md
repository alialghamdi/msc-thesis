| source.excerpts.0.value | Nevertheless , when she had almost finished dressing , and her maid was jerking the indispensable three drops of scent into a laced handkerchief that lay ready by her gloves , she did not disdain to put on two more rings and an additional bracelet in honour of her unexpected guest .Because she hated the man , was that a reason she should not look her best , even in his eyes ? As it is the soldier ' s pride and point of honour to preserve his steel untarnished , though shoes be worn and uniform in rags , the ammunition spent , the bread not come up , flanks threatened , and retreat cut off , so woman keeps her beauty bright and polished , even in the last 109 MARKET - DAY vaguely conscious , like men in a dream , between the past and the future ? For good , though not for evil , shall not that which hath been be again ? Sin and sorrow , we believe , will indeed die to all eternity ; but shall not love , though it has come down on earth to be bruised and soiled , and trodden under foot , shed its well - remembered fragrance around us again , renewed and purified , holy and stainless , for ever in heaven ? Sir Archibald ' s brow cleared as he walked on .Soon he entered the park , and made straight for the shrubberies that surrounded the house of Bridlemere . |

| source.excerpts.13.value | Sir Archibald ' s heart stirs within him ; it is so like the face of thirty years ago ; the face that has never faded in his memory , that pervades even to - day the glowing landscape , the sleeping woods , the earth , the air — above all , the blue , distant heaven , whence he can almost fancy she is looking down upon him still .Helen makes a little affected grimace of disgust at his cigar , though amongst ladies she professes to like the smell of them above all things in the open as indeed she would of asafœtida if that happened to be Uncle Archie ' s favourite perfume ; but this is a nice little opportunity to tyrannise over him , so she takes it out of his mouth in her taper fingers , and makes as if she would throw it away .has given up the vile says she , though Julia declares she delights in it . |

Oh , papa , Cockamaroo will be so disappointed ! answered Lady Julia , taking her father ' s advice , however , and swinging along by his side at an easy gallop , her delicate profile looking looking very pretty under her neat riding - hat ; the auburn hair skilfully flattened down in front , and gathered up behind , just leaving the little tip of an ear , with a jewel in it , visible ; the taper hands , in delicate yellow gloves , holding their reins with a light , firm touch far back in her lap , so as to give Cockamaroo ' s Cockamaroo ' s head all the liberty compatible with a gentle and persuasive control , while the sweet , round figure in its tightfitting tightfitting habit swayed and gave gracefully to every stride of the well - bred , powerful horse . |

| source.excerpts.17.value | I would rather climb up one of those long flickering rays to that window high in the lofty building , and enter the chamber of the only inmate still awake , an hour and more after midnight , in the house of Bridlemere .An odour of strong tobacco fills the apartment , wreathing itself about the walls and furniture as gracefully , and in far heavier volumes , than does the mist about the trees and shrubs outside .Clearing sluggishly at intervals , it discloses a short , very short pipe , such an instrument as French soldiers appropriately appropriately call a brMe - gueule , blackened with unremitting use , and held firmly between two rows of remarkably strong , white , and even teeth . |

| source.excerpts.26.value | But she kissed the sweet flowers tenderly before she put them away , and a drop fell on them that was clear and pure as the dew of heaven , though it came but from a poor , aching , earthly heart .She had always loved violets from a child , but their fragrance had never been so painful yet so dear to her as now .Then she walked on with slower and sadder step , avoiding a certain stile at which she remembered to have been affronted once by the unwelcome courtesy of a stranger , who — was no stranger now ! She started , as if she had been stung , and hurried fiercely forward in the direction of Dame Batters ' s cottage . |

In vain they point out that the earth is saturated with wet ; the wind in the east ; that not only do their own meteorological sensations , such as rheumatism , lumbago , and chronic neuralgia , insist on the propriety of remaining indoors , but that the glass has risen half an inch since last night , denoting the probability of frost , though the sky looks so like snow .The warm flood of light that turns everything to gold , was dazzling his eyes , penetrating his heart , pervading his senses , and intoxicating his brain .That first moment of submission to the spell is the best , I fancy , in the whole series of sensations called up by love ' s white magic . |
