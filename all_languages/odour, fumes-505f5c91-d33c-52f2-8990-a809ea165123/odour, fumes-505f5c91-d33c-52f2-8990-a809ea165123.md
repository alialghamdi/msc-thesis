| source.excerpts.3.value | The ambient levels of smoke and fume necessary to cause this nuisance have not , however , been established .Additionally , although evidence shows that motor vehicles emit unpleasant odours into the urban atmosphere , these odours do not appear to cause any significant public annoyance , probably because of their short - lived and localised nature .128 CLEAN AIR VOL . |

| source.excerpts.16.value | 3 Information about public attitudes and opinions to traffic nuisance is usually obtained through survey data via questionnaires and personal interviews , although at present , there is only a limited data base available .It is suspected that diesel vehicle emissions cause more nuisance to the public than petrol vehicle emissions since diesel engines produce higher levels of particulates , odour and smoke than well - maintained petrol engines .It should be emphasised however , that ambient air pollutants are de - rived from a number of sources , all of which may make a contribution to nuisance effects . |
