| source.excerpts.0.value | Some people will say , That the Plague doth oft carry a sent with it not unlike to the smell of a mellow apple , or according to others like the scent of May flowers .It is certain that infected hou ∣ ses do smell so , because they are moist and dampish , and thence pu ∣ trid , and therefore the fitter to receive the venome of pestilent air , but it is not a sent , which the Plague brings along with it , but which it finds in the house ; for I have oft smelt such scents in gar ∣ den houses , which proceeded from the dampness of the boards .The Plague is so subtil a venome , that it passeth the grosseness of mans sent , and therefore cannot be smelt ; nevertheless it is sen ∣ ted by Dogs , Cats , Flies , and other creatures , which are so much offended by it , that they usually flee such houses . |

| source.excerpts.2.value | I grant they revive the spirits , but whether this hapneth through stirring up of the spirits , or through nourishing or increasing them may be doubted .Cer ∣ tainly , not by increasing of the spirits , because that smells are crude exhalations , differing from the vital and animal spirits ; wherefore they ought first to be concocted and fitted for assimulation by gra ∣ dual elaborations of the Stomack , Liver , and Heart , and must be pu ∣ rified through the same members from their suliginous excrements .Who would say , that the spirits of Vinegar should revive through nourishing the spirits , and not through their exciting or irritating of the said spirits ? Certainly , such sharp spirits do decline from a capacity of nourishing the spirits of the brain , but nevertheless are very fit to revive by stirring and moving of them : In a like manner do pinching and rubbing of the skin revive in a swoun , not by nou ∣ rishing of the spirits , but by moving and stirring of them up . |

How doth the Devil then ride him ? leads him by the nose whither he list ; it may be directs him to a ditch , and so he is drowned ; or leaves him in a dead sleep in the high - way , and there he is rob ∣ bed or murthered ; or puts a sword into his hand to kill one or other , and so he comes to the gallows , and thence home ; or sends him to a naughty house , and there he is infected with the Devils leprosie .How doth the Devil perfume womens looks to enchant mens nostrils ? or what a nitour doth he overshade their faces with to raise mens lusts ? As for the weaknesse of your appetite , it is not hidden , when you do every day feel its force and bending to evil objects : and lastly , how wickedly are mens thoughts for the most part imployed ? In all these lieth your weaknesse , and there doth the Devil most attack you .Now then the defensive part of this military Art will lie in ma ∣ king your sallies upon the Devil , when you ever spie him moving towards you . |

| source.excerpts.6.value | The smell of a Tallow - Chandlers shop doth little offend or move our olfactive power , when we are in the shop , yea , not at all , but at our first approach before we come near to it , the smell may direct any one thither blindfold .Neither do Dogs or Hogs smell thick scents , as of excre ∣ ments or other rotten stinking smells of corrupted flesh , when they are near to them ; for did they , they would certainly abhor them ; yet it is certain they smell them at a great distance , but then that smell at a distance is not a stinking smell to them , but sweet and pleasant , for otherwise they would not be so much inticed by them ; for although such objects stunk near by , through their thick pernici ∣ ous and strong motion , yet through the grinding of the air they are mollified , and their putrid temperature is laid and equalized , and their stink is quite taken away : this appears in Musk , Civet , or Ambergreece , which if held close to the Nosthrils strike as unplea ∣ sing a stink as excrements , but again how fragrant and sweet a scent do they emit at a distance ? Even so it is with the scent of Excre ∣ ments to Dogs and Hogs .A Dog scents a Bitch a great way off , although lockt up , without seeing of her , and apprehends the scent under her Tayl to be no ill scent : Wherefore I say , That in many , if not in most scents , that , which smels sweet to a man , sents stink ∣ ing to most beasts , and that , which sents stinking to us , smells sweet to most beasts . |

| source.excerpts.28.value | The ground and reason of this proportion is , 1 .That the least predominance , whereby an element may acquire its name , must be triple , that is , thrice as many times more in quantity , then the elements affixed to it : for did an element in its purity overba ∣ lance the others but in two parts , then it could hardly retain a form , whereby its nature might be sufficiently distinguisht from the o ∣ thers ; if in more then in three parts it would be apparently discer ∣ nable that that element was mixed ; if so , then it must also be deno ∣ minated by a mixed name ; for the cause , why men generally im ∣ pose a single name upon some beings , that are mixt and compoun ∣ ded , is , because there is so little of the extrinsick body discerna ∣ ble , that it doth not deserve to be named : but if discernable , then a compounded word is applied : for instance , there is none would say , that water whereinto only a few drops of wine were instilled , was wine and water , or Oinolympha : but they would nominate it water alone , because there is so little wine in it that it is not gusta ∣ ble ; but supposing there were so much wine mingled with water , as to make it perceptible , either by tast or smell , then no doubt they would say it was wine and water .Even so it is here ; was there more then a fourth part of extrinsick Elements admitted to a single pure element , it would be perceptible : if so , then we should not nominate the elements by a single name , but by a com ∣ pound one . |

| source.excerpts.35.value | The difference between this and the gustable faculty is none other , but that the one consists in a degree of a finer and thinner consistency of spirituous air ; and the same difference is between their objects , viz .a taste is of a thicker bo ∣ dy than a scent , in manner that the scent is too subtil to strike the gustable faculty , and a sapour is too thick to strike the olfactive fa ∣ culty ; wherefore that , which through its subtility passeth the sence of taste doth thereby reach to the sense of smelling , moving its fa ∣ culty withal .It is th n apparent ; That the objects of both these senses are the same , differing only in subtilty of body , and that they are nothing but temperaments of bodies comminuted and moving the said powers immediately , yet not so , but that the subtiler parts for to move the sense , are requisite to be separated from the cour ∣ ser , and more then that , each needs a Vehicle or a medium for to be carried and directed through the subtil passages to the deep latent sensory . |

| source.excerpts.36.value | Likewise crying loud into the ears , and holding a bright light to the eyes opened by force , doth as soon revive and recal swouning pati ∣ ents as any thing ; but assuredly the working of these is by exciting and stirring the spirits , and not by nourishing of them .The more thin the olfactive Membranes and nerves are , and the more subtil the spirituous olfactive air is , the further odours or scents are perceived : But then it is requisite , that those objects , which are to move such a sense should be more subtil , because of being proportionated to the faculty : for if they are course , they will exceed the perception of such a scent ; hence it is , that those , who excell all others in exquisiteness of scent cannot attain to the smelling a thick smell near by , unless they go so far off as that those thick exhalations by moving through the air may be grinded less , and so be the better fitted for to strike the olfactive faculty : hence it is then that a Vulture being blinded and placed suddenly in a Room where dead stinking flesh is , shall not find it through his sent , al ∣ though his smelling is the most exquisite of any living creature ( ac ∣ cording to the usual Verse : Nos aper auditu , linx visu , simia gustu , Vultur odoratu praecellit , araneatactu .A Boar in hearing , a Linx in sight , a Vulture in his smell . |

Even so it is with the scent of Excre ∣ ments to Dogs and Hogs .A Dog scents a Bitch a great way off , although lockt up , without seeing of her , and apprehends the scent under her Tayl to be no ill scent : Wherefore I say , That in many , if not in most scents , that , which smels sweet to a man , sents stink ∣ ing to most beasts , and that , which sents stinking to us , smells sweet to most beasts .It will not be difficult now to give a reason , why and how a Dog winds the scent of a Hare at so great a di ∣ stance ; it is , because there are some exhalations or evaporations emanated through the habit of a Hares body , and especially of her belly and inguina , inhering in the ground and in the air near about it , over which the Hare hath taken her flight , the which al ∣ though they be very subtil & amp ; thin , yet they do sensibly and perfectly move the olfactive power of the Dog : this sent is as intirely pleasing to the Dog as the sight of his eagerness in pursuit pleases the Hun ∣ ters , and so they are both equally inticed to the pursuit of the Hare . |

| source.excerpts.49.value | This flame possibly appears like unto a Candle , playing and moving to and fro the air , and thence is also called a fools fire , or Ignis Fatuus , seu erraticus , because it proves sometimes an occasion of leading Travellers that are belated out of their Road ; for by their coming near to it the air is propelled , which again protrudes the flame forwards , and so by continuing to follow it , imagining the same to be some Candle in a Town or Vil ∣ lage , are oft misled into a ditch or hole : Or if they go from it , when they are once come near , the light will follow them , because in receding , they make a cavity , which the next succeeding air accurs to fill up .The generation of these lights is more frequent near muddy Pools , Church - yards , and other putrid places , that abound with such sulphureous bodies .The said sulphureous parts , if being of a less density , condensed and united by the dense wool of a mans cloathes , or hair , or the hairs of a Horse or Oxe and the foresaid coldnesses , it takes fire at the forementioned places , but flames so subtilly , that it is uncapable of burning : This sort of Meteor is called an Ignis lambens , a licking fire , because it slakes then here then there , like to spirits of Wine flaming . |

These things do not attract without piercing into a mans Veins and Arteries , and through their greater force of heat and violence do protrude the less heat of the body , and by a short stay do put the whole body into a consuming fire ; How many men have I seen murther ∣ ed in that manner ?

| source.excerpts.63.value | The more thin the olfactive Membranes and nerves are , and the more subtil the spirituous olfactive air is , the further odours or scents are perceived : But then it is requisite , that those objects , which are to move such a sense should be more subtil , because of being proportionated to the faculty : for if they are course , they will exceed the perception of such a scent ; hence it is , that those , who excell all others in exquisiteness of scent cannot attain to the smelling a thick smell near by , unless they go so far off as that those thick exhalations by moving through the air may be grinded less , and so be the better fitted for to strike the olfactive faculty : hence it is then that a Vulture being blinded and placed suddenly in a Room where dead stinking flesh is , shall not find it through his sent , al ∣ though his smelling is the most exquisite of any living creature ( ac ∣ cording to the usual Verse : Nos aper auditu , linx visu , simia gustu , Vultur odoratu praecellit , araneatactu .A Boar in hearing , a Linx in sight , a Vulture in his smell .An Ape in taste , a Spider in feeling do us far excell . |

| source.excerpts.64.value | All these are great and dangerous weaknesses .Are not some people so corrupt and slavishly tied to see shows and playes , that there is n r a day , but they must see either a show , or a play ; they dream of playes ; they do constantly talk of playes ; and if there was but a fine show or play to be seen , the next dis ∣ course is , what have you not seen such a show , such a rare play ? Now mark the Devils policy , there is never a tempting play or show , but the Devil sets it off either by casting a lustre upon their eyes , or a pleasantnesse upon the gestures , a splendour upon the habit , and a clangour upon the speech of the Actours : You cannot imagine how dead and simple a play would seem without the Devils vernishing of it ; and this is evident , many having seen rare playes , upon whose eyes the Devils could not work , and to them they appeared as nauseous and simple , as it proved admi ∣ rable and rare to others , upon whose eyes this glosse would take .The like may be said of painted or patcht faces ; how strangely are they set off with a glosse upon some mens eyes , and how ugly they appear to others , whose eyes are uncapable of a glosse ? To these they seem like a picture , or a patcht thing made up by Art ; like to a hansome doublet with a patch upon the elbow . |

| source.excerpts.66.value | ) Because the scents being thick are not thin enough to strike his subtill smell ; but then again , he shall perceive those scents at the greatest distance , where these thick scents are so much subtiliated through the length of passage , that there he perceives them very sensibly , as being fitted to his scent .The smell of a Tallow - Chandlers shop doth little offend or move our olfactive power , when we are in the shop , yea , not at all , but at our first approach before we come near to it , the smell may direct any one thither blindfold .Neither do Dogs or Hogs smell thick scents , as of excre ∣ ments or other rotten stinking smells of corrupted flesh , when they are near to them ; for did they , they would certainly abhor them ; yet it is certain they smell them at a great distance , but then that smell at a distance is not a stinking smell to them , but sweet and pleasant , for otherwise they would not be so much inticed by them ; for although such objects stunk near by , through their thick pernici ∣ ous and strong motion , yet through the grinding of the air they are mollified , and their putrid temperature is laid and equalized , and their stink is quite taken away : this appears in Musk , Civet , or Ambergreece , which if held close to the Nosthrils strike as unplea ∣ sing a stink as excrements , but again how fragrant and sweet a scent do they emit at a distance ? Even so it is with the scent of Excre ∣ ments to Dogs and Hogs . |
