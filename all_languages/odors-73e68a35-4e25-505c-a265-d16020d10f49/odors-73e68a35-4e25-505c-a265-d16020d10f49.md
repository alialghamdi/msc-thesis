When Protozoa occur in great numbers in fresh water , and especially in drinking water , they may cause considerable annoyance ; for by the color , odor , and taste which they impart they render the water unfit to drink .The colors are due in the main to the Phytoflagellida , and only those forms which are capable of making their own food are able to live in pure drinking waters . |
