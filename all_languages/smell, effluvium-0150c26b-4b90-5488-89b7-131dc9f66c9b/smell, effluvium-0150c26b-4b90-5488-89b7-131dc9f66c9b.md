In some senses , perhaps , nothing is really of use , except baptism and repentance .The aspect and the smell of Ostend , although the latter is by no means bad for a fishing - town , and the former former ( the streets and squares being straight and wide , the houses good , well - built , cheerful , and well - windowed ) is not unpleasant , made me nevertheless rejoice , rather than regret , that most likely I should never enter its walk or sand - banks again .The houses were closely shut : it would have been pleasant to have seen the inside of one : the windows were defended against prying eyes by muslin curtains and by Holland blinds . |

| source.excerpts.24.value | Thursday , December 29 - — The most painful part of travelling is , that one makes acquaintance with 266 TURIN that he would cry , That is right ; if you run short of faggots , I will give you a few ; help yourselves from my wood stack ; I will lend you my wife ' s new pair of bellows to blow up the fire and singe the monster But experience and history contradict speculations , which to our reason appear to be so probable .The ballet was rich , and there were horses upon the stage ; but so powerful was the odour of garlic , that I soon withdrew , singing , like Solomon : The mandrakes mandrakes give a smell ! Tuesday , February 7 .— I had been told , when I sent to take a place , that the diligence was full ; but I was informed this morning , that there was a seat in the cabriolet : I hurried together my things , and in half an hour was at the coach - office . |

| source.excerpts.25.value | Our supper was in the rough ; the wine execrable .My bed - room stunk , and the windows could not be opened .They neglected to call me in the morning , although particularly desired — a gross breach of social faith ; and no attendance could be procured either by bell or voice . |

| source.excerpts.26.value | Having finished my letters , I walked quietly about the quiet , large , and handsome city .The smell of the canals at this season is most distressing , odious , overwhelming , and oppressive ; persons residing here must either pine away and vanish , or become used to it , so as not to perceive it .As a Christian , I am bound to be tolerant towards my erring brethren , who may not have the same lights that I have , therefore I would forgive the Church of Rome one half of her errors , errors , great as our divines say they are , if her children would give up the use of salt fish , with the poisonous odour of which all living and all dead things are defiled . |
