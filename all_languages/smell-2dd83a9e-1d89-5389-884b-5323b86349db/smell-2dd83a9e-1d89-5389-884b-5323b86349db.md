| source.excerpts.12.value | The surprise vanished when I became convinced that the arrangement of the scent - scales in Dione vanillae is connected with that of the other Maracuja butterflies , by intermediate forms .In Heliconius , where the scent - scales are confined to that part of the hind - wing covered by the fore - wing , they are always most numerous along the veins .In Golaenis dido male , as I believe I mentioned in my first communication , the scales are not confined to that one spot , but scattered over the whole wing , and , as a more accurate investigation has now shown , they occur exclusively on the veins . |

The position and shape of these sexual cavities is such that the extremity of the abdomen might easily be applied to them , and as the hairs of the abdominal organs unite in the form of a brush , it would not be impossible , or even difficult , to introduce them into the depths of the cavity .I confess , frankly , that this idea appears to me to be well founded , but it is only by a comparative study of the numerous species of Danais that we can arrive at a definite solution of this interesting problem . |

If that were so , one could understand the hundred - fold predominance of the males recorded by Bates , and the entire correspondence between the sexes in pattern and colour .If the possession of a scent repulsive to pursuers were confined to the males , and the sexes in equal numbers , then their enemies would secure a palatable mouthful just as often as a disagreeable one , and would scarcely be induced to give up the capture of Ithomiae . |

If that were so , one could understand the hundred - fold predominance of the males recorded by Bates , and the entire correspondence between the sexes in pattern and colour . |
