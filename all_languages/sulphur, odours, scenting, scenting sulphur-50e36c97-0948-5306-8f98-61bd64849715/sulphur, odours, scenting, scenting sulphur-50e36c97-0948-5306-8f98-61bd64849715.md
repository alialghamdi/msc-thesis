What if the world of beauty I had been content to live in was a Satanic show , and the real thing was that dead , topsy - turvy world down there in the cold , grey lake under the reeking mists ?

People could not lift their hands high enough in admiration because he followed the law of his nature , because he preferred a simple living , simply earned , while for criminals who followed equally the laws of their nature they had anger rather than pity .As well praise the bee for yielding honey or the rose for making fragrant die air .Certainly his character had more of honey than of sting , of rose than of thorn ; humility was an unnecessary addition to the world ' s suffering ; but that he did not lack sting or thorn , his own sisters had discovered when they had tried to keep their excommunicated brother out of his patrimony . |
