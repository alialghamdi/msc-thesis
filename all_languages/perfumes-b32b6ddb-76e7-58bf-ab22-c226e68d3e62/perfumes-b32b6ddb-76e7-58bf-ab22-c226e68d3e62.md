| source.excerpts.3.value | The substances to which the perfume of the la ^ t - mentioned flowers is due have not as yet been fully investigated , but it is known that the hyacinth contains benzyl benzoate , with probably free benzyl alcohol , and also esters of cinnamic alcohol .The odours have been well imitated in various artificial oils and extracts , the exact composition of which is gene - rally a trade secret , but it may be noted that phenylacetic Index Folio 973 62 THE CHEMIST AND DEUGGIST August 30 , 1919 aldehyde , C6Hs .CH2 . |

| source.excerpts.4.value | This compound , which is an essential constituent of lemon oil and is quite widely distributed in Nature , is the aldehyde corresponding to geraniol , from which it may readily be obtained by oxida - tion .Citral , apart from its individual value as a con - stituent of many fragrant oils , is of particular interest and importance from the fact that from it , by condensation with acetone , there is produced the substance known as ionone , which is the basis of the artificial violet perfumes .In the first step of this process citral and acetone , in the presence of alkalis , condense with the elimination of water to form a compound termed pseudo - ionone : CioHieO + ( CH3 ) 2CO = C1 . |

| source.excerpts.6.value | With tliis object in view a considera - tion based chiefly upon , the usual botanical classification of plants would appear to be the most practicable , and such a classification has indeed been adopted by some of the standard works which treat of the essential oils .The cryptogamous or flowerless plants do not , as a rule , possess any very marked or distinctive odour , although in a few instances such properties have been observed in certain alga ? , fungi , lichens , and ferns .The essential oil or other individual substance to which this property is due is , however , always present in very small amount , and as the chemical character of these products is as yet but little known , they cannot be considered to possess any particular interest . |

| source.excerpts.7.value | The es .5ential oil obtained from tbe root is said to resemble in odour that of ginger , but differs by being also somewhat camphor - like , which is due to the presence of cineol .The most familiar representative of the Zingiberacerc is ginger , from Zingiber officinale , Roscoe , which is culti - vated in the Far East , as well as in the West Indies and A ~ frica . |

| source.excerpts.9.value | E .The family of Zingiberacece includes a number of j plants , the roots or rhizomes of which possess aromatic properties .Among these there may be noted the curcuma { Curcuma longa , Linne ) , which , although yielding from - 3 to 5 per cent , of an essential oil , is cultivated more especially in India and China on accoimt of the yellow colouring matter contained in the rhizome . |

| source.excerpts.10.value | If this vital activity were destroyed by means of a volatile liquid or the use of a warm fat the amount of perfume developed would be very greatly diminished .From the fat which has been more or less saturated with the perfume of the flowers â   the so - called pomade â   the odorous prin - ciples may be extracted by treatment with strong alcohol , and by exposing this extract to a low temperature the last portions of fat are separated .In this way many of the concentrated extracts are obtained - which constitute the most highly esteemed floral perfumes . |

| source.excerpts.11.value | The more or less characteristic odour which many plants possess rarely depends upon the presence of a single substance , but is usually due to a complex mixture of substances , in which , however , some one compound may largely predominate .These odorous principles are generally obtained by a process of steam distillation , and as such products are for the most part - in the form of liquids which are sparingly soluble in water , they are comprehended under the broad title of essential oils or volatile oils , in French essence , an expression which serves in a way to differentiate them from the so - called fatty or fixed oils , which , however , differ appreciably in their physical and chemical characters .In cases where the oil does not pre - exist in the plant , but is formed by the hydrolysis of a glucoside , as in the mustard seed , bitter almond , gaultheria leaves , and sweet birch bai ' k , a pre - liminary digestion with water is necessary before distilla - tion . |

| source.excerpts.18.value | The constituent of the oil which imparts to it the characteristic violet odour is a liquid , cyclic ' ketone , termed irone , C13H20O .It was the isolation and investigation of this compound that led to the syn - thetic production of the isomeric ketone , ionone , which , together with its homologues , is now so largely used in the preparation of violet perfumes .As previously indicated , this eubstance is obtained by the condensation of the aldehyde , citral , with acetone , a substance termed pseudo - ionone being first formed , which , through inversion by means of acids , is converted into ionone . |

| source.excerpts.20.value | By ileading dry hydrogen chloride into completely dry and cooled pinene , the so - called pinene hydrochloride , or more properly bornyl chloride , CioHirCl , is obtained .As this is a crystalline compound having a camphor - like odour , it formerly received the incorrect appellation of " artificial camphor ." By the subsequent elimination of hydrogen chloride from bornyl chloride there is obtained the terpene camphene , which is of interest as being the only solid hydrocarbon of the formula CioHie which occurs in Natnre . |

| source.excerpts.21.value | The essential oils distilled from pine needles differ markedly in character from the proper turpentine oils , as in them the pinene is replaced to a considerable extent by other terpenes , such as camphene , limonene or dipentene , phellandrene , sylvestrene , and cadinene , and they also contain especially notable proportions of the acetic ester of borneol , amounting in the oil of the hem - lock spruce , Abies canadensis , Michaux , or Tsuga cana - densis , Carr , to as much as 50 per cent .This ester possesses the characteristic fragrant odour of the pine and is used in perfumery .k The resinous balsam obtained from the so - called " Nut Pine " or " Digger Pine , " Pinus sabiniana , Douglas , is of particular interest inasmuch as it yields on distillation an essential oil which differs completely in composition and properties from the turpentine oils . |

| source.excerpts.43.value | The length of time during which the flowers are allowed to remain in the chassis is said to be about 24 hours for jasmine , 48 hours for jonquil , and 72 hours for the tuberose , and the operation is usually repeated about thirty times in order that the desired degree of absorption or concen - tration of the perfume may be obtained .With each repetition of the process the arrangement of the chassis is reversed , the fresh flowers being strewn on the layer of fat - which was previously on the under side of the glass , but which now becomes the upper side , in order to effect an equal distribution oÂ £ the perfume .The reason for emp ' loying the cold method of extraction for certain flowers depends upon the interesting observation that the essential oil to which their fragrance is due does not exist ready formed , or at least in only very insignificant amount , but is ycontinually produced during the life of the cells . |

| source.excerpts.100.value | Some of the essential oils which become somewhat impaired by heat are obtained by expression , notably those of the citrus fruits , such as the orange , lemon , and bergamot .In other instances the odour of certain flowers is of so delicate a nature that it can only be obtained in a tangible form by extracting the material with a volatile solvent or by maceration with a fixed solvent , such as an oil or fat , either with or without the aid of heat .The use of heat in the process of maceration appears to be desirable ' for extracting the perfume from the violet and rose , as also from orange and cassie flowers ^ and this method of procedure is known by the French expression of enfleurage a chaud . |
