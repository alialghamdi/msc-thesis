| source.excerpts.1.value | A nice man , useful to Europeans , he had made his fortune , as I have before said , by purchasing sapphires in the old days when these were brought in Kullu by the kilta - ( as much as a wheel - barrow ) load and sold for what they would fetch .But though a rich man , he lived , as the Maltese are said to live , on the smell of an oiled rag ! We heard two European friends of ours bad been attacked by cholera , but had recovered .The padre said there had been one or two suspicious cases in Lahoul of immigrants from PART Y . |

A greater scourge , however , than the dust or the locust , had invaded Kullu .On the 1st of May we received the alarming intelligence that , for the first time for forty years , cholera had broken out in the valley . |
