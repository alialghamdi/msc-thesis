| source.excerpts.0.value | Ether induces a very much longer stage of insensibility than nitrous oxide , but the objections to its use are also very considerable , and it is always better in dental practice to avoid employing it if possible .It has a very strong pungent odour , which is regarded by most people as very unpleasant , and often causes vomiting , coughing , and struggling on the part of the patient .1 ' he after - effects are usually also veiy unpleasant , nausea and vomiting ( very serious complications in operations upon the abdomen ) , headache , dizziness , and general malaise not at all unfrequently following its administration ; moreover , it is generally allowed to be not quite so safe as nitrous oxide . |

| source.excerpts.1.value | This fact should , in my opinion , be printed in large letters at the entrance of every church and every theatre , and taught to every child in the nursery .A person with a weak heart in a fainting con - dition , held up and sometimes hugged tight by well - meaning friends armed with scent and luke - warm water , is within a measurable distance of being fondled lovingly out of this life altogether , yet how frequent a spectacle it is â   the anxious friend sedulously stopping the heartâ   s action , the curious and kindly circle shutting off the air , or at any rate rendering it warm , stuffy , and impure , and the officious bystander , with a handkerchief reeking with scent , poisoning what little air does reach the patient .With such a scene before my mindâ   s eye , I feel excused for urging . |

| source.excerpts.2.value | After eight or nine good inspirations a sufficient stage of insensibility is reached to commence the exhibition of ether .* Many authorities pass ether and gas through the same face - piece , but there is an objection to this practice , namely , the face - piece becomes so im - pregnated with ether that the whole apparatus reeks of it , and afterwards , when gas alone is passed through it , patients frequently complain of the smell and taste , and even in some cases of headache and malaise ; thus nitrous oxide , which is distin - guished for its freedom from taste and after - effects , is sometimes unfairly charged with producing these symptoms .It is with the greatest possible diffidence , however , that I mention this objection , seeing that many ad - ministrators of the greatest experience and ability adopt this combined method . |
