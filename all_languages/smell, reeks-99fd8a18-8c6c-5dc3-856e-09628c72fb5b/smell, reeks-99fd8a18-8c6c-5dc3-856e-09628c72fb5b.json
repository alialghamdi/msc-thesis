        "value": "After eight or nine good inspirations a sufficient stage of insensibility is reached to commence the exhibition of ether .* Many authorities pass ether and gas through the same face - piece , but there is an objection to this practice , namely , the face - piece becomes so im - pregnated with ether that the whole apparatus reeks of it , and afterwards , when gas alone is passed through it , patients frequently complain of the smell and taste , and even in some cases of headache and malaise ; thus nitrous oxide , which is distin - guished for its freedom from taste and after - effects , is sometimes unfairly charged with producing these symptoms .It is with the greatest possible diffidence , however , that I mention this objection , seeing that many ad - ministrators of the greatest experience and ability adopt this combined method .",
