| source.excerpts.0.value | No marvel , therefore , if purples be so much sought for , and men are to be held excused if they run a - madding after purples .But how should the other shell - fish , called Conchylia , be so dear and high - priced , considering the tincture of them carries so strong and stinking a savour ; so sullen and melancholy a colour , inclining to a blue or watchet , and resembling rather the angry and raging sea in a tempest ? Now , if I should lay a straw here , and proceed no further in this discourse discourse of purples and such like , surely our luxurious and riotous spendthrifts spendthrifts would think they had great wrong , and were defrauded of their right ; they might , I say , complain of me , and condemn me of idleness and negligence .Therefore , I care not much to put my head within the dyer ' s shops and work - houses , that like as every man , for the necessity of this life , knows how the price of corn goes ; even so our fine folks and brave dandies , who ta ke such pleasure and delight in these colours may be perfect , 124 A CALM becomes inevitable — it is , when the mouth fills with saliva , and then the sooner it takes place the better . |

| source.excerpts.23.value | The hills are difficult of ascent , owing to their exceeding steepness , the closeness of the brambles , and the number of loose stones that are put in motion by the attempt ; but the view from the summit is superb , embracing the numerous bays , creeks , and islands along this varied and beautiful coast , as well as the inland country , which consists of a succession of mountains similar to those surrounding surrounding the bay — wild , rugged fells , without a trace of cultivation , but with forests of enormous timber , too massive and too far distant distant from the coast to be turned to any account by the dwellers in these regions .At an elevation of eight hundred feet I found the splendid erica mediterranea , growing in great luxuriance , and perfectly white with its fragrant blossoms , that perfumed the air with a scent like that of meadow - sweet .It here attains the height of eight or ten feet , and forms a belt along the hills at an elevation of about five hundred feet above the sea level , and altogether altogether presents one of the most magnificent decorations that the vegetable world affords these alpine regions . |

| source.excerpts.24.value | The descriptions given of this remarkable well , both in the Scriptures and by Josephus and the early writers on the localities of the Holy City , and the position which it holds with regard to the ancient ancient walls — as I have shown in the preceding part of this volume when treating of the topography — leave little doubt upon my mind regarding its identity .I do not think that it is connected with or receives its supply from the aqueduct that brings the water from the cisterns of Solomon , to be noticed hereafter , especially as that water is tasteless ; whereas this is a mineral spring of a brackish taste , and somewhat of the smell of Harrogate Harrogate water , but in a very slight degree .* It is said to possess considerable medicinal properties ; and is much frequented by pilgrims . |

| source.excerpts.28.value | Coffee was presented , in small china cups holding about a third of one of ours , not on a tray , but handed to each individual by a separate servant , in a small silver stand , ( ~ urf , ) exactly like an egg - cup , which I always found very serviceable ; as the cups are so hot , one is in great danger of burning their fingers .The coffee is far superior to that commonly used by us ; it is drank without cream or sugar , boiling hot , and , as they never strain it , it is thick as mud ; yet it has a most delicious fragrance .Who will say that it is not more grateful and more rational , while it is fully as refreshing , and a much less injurious beverage than those intoxicating liquors in use in our northern countries ? In this , my first visit into polite society in the east , I was surprised surprised at seeing each of the Mooslims present make the usual salutation , by touching the forehead with the tips of the righthand righthand fingers , on receiving their coffee . |
