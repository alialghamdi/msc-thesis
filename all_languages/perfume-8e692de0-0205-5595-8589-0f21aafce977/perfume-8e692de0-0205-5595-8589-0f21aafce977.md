| source.excerpts.0.value | Were I asked for a description of Portuguese character , I would say , it was one partaking of every had quality belonging to a native of the Peninsula , without one of those redeeming virtues , which , in some degree , render interestÂ ¬ ing and valuable the character of their neighbours .I would rather turn to the sunny side of the picture , and conÂ ¬ duct the reader to any thing worth seeing , without his being - assailed by any of the thousand and one stenches of Lisbon .By the way , talking of the sunny side of the picture , I may observe , that the sunny side of the streets may be always known by the number of those prehensile operations going forward in the winÂ ¬ dows of both rich and poor , and which fully accounts for the decrease of the monkey tribe , since the days of Beckford , when they were hired out to perform those little offices upon the head that filial piety now takes upon itself . |

He has now a vessel on the stocks , which he said he would have launched before we left , to afford us an opportunity of seeing how wrell the Turks can manage such matters . |

| source.excerpts.4.value | The hills are difficult of ascent , owing to their exceeding steepness , the closeness of the brambles , and the number of loose stones that are put in motion by the attempt ; but the view from the summit is superb , embracing the numerous baj ^ s , creeks , and islands along this varied and beautiful coast , as well as the inland country , which consists of a succession of mountains similar to those surÂ ¬ rounding the bay â   wild , rugged fells , without a trace of cultivation , but with forests of enormous timber , too massive and too far disÂ ¬ tant from the coast to be turned to any account by the dwellers in these regions .At an elevation of eight hundred feet I found the splendid erica mediterranean growing in great luxuriance , and perfectly white with its fragrant blossoms , that perfumed the air with a scent like that of meadow - sweet .It here attains the height of eight or ten feet , and forms a belt along the hills at an elevation of about five hundred feet above the sea level , and altoÂ ¬ gether presents one of the most magnificent decorations that the vegetable world affords these alpine regions . |

| source.excerpts.12.value | About mid - day the whole island appeared buried in a vast cloud , threatenÂ ¬ ing total darkness ; the barometer fell considerably .The air became very oppressive , with a strong sulphurous smell , and the wind veered about to nearly every point of the compass .At one oâ   clock the rain began to fall in torrents ; and about an hour afterwards I perceived , at a distance of about a mile from shore , an immense rising in the sea , which was soon conÂ ¬ nected with a mass of dark clouds overhanging the bay , to all appearance charging themselves or drawing the water from the sea for the space of about ten minutes , followed immediately by a heavy swell or rising of the ocean , which swept towards the shore ; and although I was at a considerable MODE OF LANDING . |

| source.excerpts.22.value | I may with justice sum up a description of this city in the faithful and energetic lines applied to Cologne by Coleridge , whose name will soften down the asperities that might otherwise grate on ears polite â   - â   A town of monks and bones , And pavements fanged with murderous stones .And rags , and hags , and hideous wenches â   I counted two and seventy stenches .â   In a word , the city is worthy of a people degraded by ignorance and the grossest superstition . |

| source.excerpts.23.value | The environs of the town are very beautiful ; and the face of the country , despite the chilling , withering influence of its governÂ ¬ ment , lovely .Sunny banks , clothed with cyclamens , which were putting forth the gayest liveries of spring , and sheltered vales , vdiere â   feathery palm - trees rise , â   and the perfume of the lime and the orange blossom scents the air , can never lose one atom of their charms , though saddened by the reflection engendered by the knowledge of the canker that for years has sapped the indiÂ ¬ genous verdure of this beauteous isle .Could accommodation be obtained , Rhodes has many recomÂ ¬ mendations to the notice of the invalid . |

| source.excerpts.24.value | I scarcely knew on what object to rest my eye , so strange and varied was the appearance and costume of the crowd assembled beneath .The diversity of language , the flaunting of the silken banners that slowly moved to and fro from the top of the sepulÂ ¬ chral dome , the gaudy paintings of the Greeks , the waving of censers , and the perfume of incense â   the crowds of devoted pilÂ ¬ grims , some in attitudes of deep emotion , round each sacred spot ; the turbaned Greek ; the high - capt Persian ; the shaggy coat of the Muscovite , or the Siberian ; the long beard and dark , downÂ ¬ cast visage of the despised Copt ; the rich dresses of the different ecclesiastics ; the mitred abbot , the venerable patriarch , and the cord - girt friar , shall never fade from my memory .But when to these I add the scenes that took place upon some of the succeedÂ ¬ ing days that are considered more important and sacred , when the devotees joined in full chorus , though , to speak correctly , it was any thing but chorus or harmony , the effect was indescribable . |

| source.excerpts.25.value | There is an extensive hospital outside the city , in the large barrack erected by Napoleon , but in a professional point of view it is lamentably deficient .The chief surgeon , an Italian , was going his rounds at the time I visited it ; and in addition to a most incongruous Franco - Turkish costume , he had on a large linen apron , tucked under his chin , of any colour but white , with a capacious pocket in front , well stored with plasters , pills , and potions , caustics and instruments , which were administered , and applied in turns as he went along , preceded by an hospital mate , with a tin pan containing burning incense , which , though a perfume , and highly needful , was stifling in the extreme .There are many good bazaars in Alexandria , and in the Frank quarter there are some shops , kept mostly by Greeks and Italians , where every description of European article may be obtained . |

| source.excerpts.26.value | The immediate sides of the vale are clothed with groves of magniÂ ¬ ficent chestnuts , their autumnal liveries well contrasting with the fresher tinting of the leafy evergreens ; in the bottom , which is watered by a gentle rivulet , the vine grows even at this elevation , and the numerous class of cucurbitae â   the melons , gourds , and pumpkins â   form graceful festoons , as they wreathe from branch to branch of the young chestnut and orange trees â   their golden blossoms and enormous fruit , hanging by a single stem , so light and graceful , look as if suspended in mid - air .Numerous plants of balm scent the air , and the fuschia and hydrangia grow to a size almost incredible .Small white cottages , neatly thatched with rye - straw , with the villagers seated before them grinding the quern for their morning meal , give life and animation to this fairy scene . |

| source.excerpts.27.value | Coffee was presented , in small china cups holding about a third of one of ours , not on a tray , but handed to each individual by a separate servant , in a small silver stand , ( zurf , ) exactly like an egg - cup , which I always found very serviceable ; as the cups are so hot , one is in great danger of burning their fingers .The coffee is far superior to that commonly used by us ; it is drank without cream or sugar , boiling hot , and , as they never strain it , it is thick as mud ; yet it has a most delicious fragrance .Who will say that it is not more grateful and more rational , while it is fully as refreshing , and a much less injurious beverage than those intoxicating liquors in use in our northern countries ? In this , my first visit into polite society in the east , I was surÂ ¬ prised at seeing each of the Mooslims present make the usual salutation , by touching the forehead with the tips of the right - hand fingers , on receiving their coffee . |

| source.excerpts.28.value | No marvel , therefore , if purples be so much sought for , and men are to be held excused if they run a - madding after purples .â   But how should the other shell - fish , called Conchylia , be so dear and high - priced , considering the tincture of them carries so strong and stinking a savour ; so sullen and melancholy a colour , inclining to a blue or watchet , and resembling rather the angry and raging sea in a tempest ? â   Now , if I should lay a straw here , and proceed no further in this disÂ ¬ course of purples and such like , surely our luxurious and riotous spendÂ ¬ thrifts would think they had great wrong , and were defrauded of their right ; they might , I say , complain of me , and condemn me of idleness and negligence .Therefore , I care not much to put my head within the dyerâ   s shops and work - houses , that like as every man , for the necessity of this life , knows how the price of corn goes ; even so our fine folks and brave dandies , who ta ke such pleasure and delight in these colours may be perfect , APPENDIX . |

| source.excerpts.29.value | The descriptions given of this remarkable well , both in the Scriptures and by Josephus and the early writers on the localities of the Holy City , and the position which it holds with regard to the anÂ ¬ cient walls â   as I have shown in the preceding part of this volume when treating of the topography â   leave little doubt upon my mind regarding its identity .I do not think that it is connected with or receives its supply from the aqueduct that brings the water from the cisterns of Solomon , to be noticed hereafter , especially as that water is tasteless ; whereas this is a mineral spring of a brackish taste , and somewhat of the smell of HarÂ ¬ rogate water , but in a very slight degree .* It is said to possess considerable medicinal properties ; and is much frequented by pilgrims . |
