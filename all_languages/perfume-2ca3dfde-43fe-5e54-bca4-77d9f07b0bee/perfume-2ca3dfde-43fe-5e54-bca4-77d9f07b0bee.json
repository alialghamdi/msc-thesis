        "value": "I wonder if you ever reflected that our entire contact with the outer world , our entire knowledge of it , is in the last analysis dependent upon but one sense , the sense of touch , and that the sensory nerves , those telegraphic lines between our consciousness and the outer world , respond to but one operator , direct contact ? Yet this is strictly so .We see , because waves of light break upon the shores of vision ; we hear , because waves of sound strike against the ear drum ; we smell , because minute particles of the odoriferous substance , or perhaps because peculiar and as yet unnamed waves induced by such a substance , impinge against our noses ; we taste , because of the direct impact of food and drink against the sensitive nerve ends of the tongue .We have but one sense , a tactile sense , and if instead of manual training we should say tactile training , we should pretty nearly hit the mark .",
