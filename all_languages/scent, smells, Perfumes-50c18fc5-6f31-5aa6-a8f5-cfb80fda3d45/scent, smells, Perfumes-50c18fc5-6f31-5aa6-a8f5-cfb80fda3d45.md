| source.excerpts.0.value | 278 .128 A B C OF NERVES had to infer , for instance , that he was stimulating the centre for vision when the animal turned its head and eyes in a parÂ ¬ ticular direction as though seeing someÂ ¬ thing , and the centre for hearing when it pricked up its ears , as though trying to hear something , and the centre for smell when it dilated its nostrils as though smelling someÂ ¬ thing .There is much evidence from Pathology and Medicine that corroborates the existence both of motor and sensory centres . |

| source.excerpts.1.value | When his lips were tickled , he dreamt that a pitch - plaster was being torn off his face by the old doctor of his childhood .Perfumes brought close to the nostrils induced dreams of pleasant smells , as when he dreamt he was in a conservatory , and on one occasion in a well - known scent shop in Cairo .When a drop of water was placed on his forehead , Maury dreamt he was in Italy in hot weather perspiring and drinking wine . |

| source.excerpts.2.value | Thus , people â   going off â   have a sense of floating , or flying or sinking because their sense of weight and of movement has been abolished ; they can still smell the chloroform and see and hear .Next , smell and taste vanish , but the patient can see and hear ; then sight goes and then hearing .The experienced anaesthetist knows that within the next few moments pain will have been abolished although the sense of touch may still be present . |

| source.excerpts.3.value | One of the cerebral structures old in the hisÂ ¬ tory of vertebrates is the olfactory lobeâ   the central organ of smell .Fishes have large olfactory lobes .Animals which have the keenÂ ¬ est sense of smell have this olfactory lobe the most largely developed . |

| source.excerpts.4.value | When only one occipito - angular region was destroyed , the blindness was only partial ; both regions had to be removed before the blindness was total and permanent .Ferrierâ   s description of the utter helplessness of the monkey is very striking : after double removal it had to depend entirely on smell and touch for information about its food , neither of these senses being in any way impaired .The discovery of the centres for hearing was made on exactly similar lines . |

| source.excerpts.5.value | There is no doubt that a person ' s own snoring can be the source of his dreams .Both the appropriate and inappropriate type of dream is well described in Romeo and Juliet , where Mercutio says that Queen Mab , the fairies ' midwifeâ   â   gallops night by night Oâ   er lawyersâ   fingers who straight dream on fees , Oâ   er ladiesâ   lips who straight on kisses dream , Sometimes she gallops oâ   er a courtierâ   s nose And then dreams he of smelling out a suit , And sometimes comes she with a tithe - pigâ   s tail Tickling a parsonâ   s nose as aâ   lies asleep , Then dreams he of another benefice : Sometimes she driveth oâ   er a soldierâ   s neck , And then he dreams of cutting foreign throats , Of breaches , ambuscades and Spanish blades , Of healths , five fathoms deep , and then anon Drums in his ear , at which he starts and wakes , And , being thus frighted , swears a prayer or two , And sleeps again .â   The relationship between a particular stimulus and the subsequent dream was made the subject of experimentation many years ago by the Frenchman , Alfred Maury . |

| source.excerpts.6.value | 1 That there is such a thing as pain by itself and as distinct from the sensations is corÂ ¬ roborated by the interesting fact that in chloroform anaesthesia all the varieties of sensation are not abolished at the same time , but , on the contrary , in the following order : â   the muscular sense and sense of weight , smell and taste , sight , hearing , pain and lastly the sense of contact .Thus , people â   going off â   have a sense of floating , or flying or sinking because their sense of weight and of movement has been abolished ; they can still smell the chloroform and see and hear .Next , smell and taste vanish , but the patient can see and hear ; then sight goes and then hearing . |

| source.excerpts.7.value | This reflex flow of saliva , which occurs after hearing , in this case , a musical note , is called â   a conditioned reflex T 88 A B C OF NERVES All sorts of experiences may in this fashion be made to produce the reflex flow of saliva without any reference whatever to food .Thus , not only the smell of food , the sight of food , or the sight of the man coming with the food , but the rattle of a plate , a musical sound , and a flash of light , can all be made reflexly saliva - producing .This is what is called a â   conditioned â   reflex . |

| source.excerpts.8.value | To produce total deafness , the whole of certain convolutions on both sides of the head had to be excised ; and when this was done the animal was quite unable to hear the loudest sounds , no matter how close to the ear .A B C OF NERVES 136 By similar experimentation , the cerebral seats of most of the other senses have been explored ; and we are not at all surprised to know that the centres for the senses of smell and taste , so closely associated in our experience , are situated very close to each other in the brain .While the anatomical and physiological independence of the sensory centres has thus been established , it is perfectly clear that when in action those sensory centres must be in the most intimate and immediate relationship . |

| source.excerpts.9.value | Fishes have large olfactory lobes .Animals which have the keenÂ ¬ est sense of smell have this olfactory lobe the most largely developed .The cells composing the neo - pallium are not by any means all of the same type ; histologists have come to describe three main layers in it , known , respectively , from above downwards as the supra - granular , the granular , and the infra - granular layers . |
