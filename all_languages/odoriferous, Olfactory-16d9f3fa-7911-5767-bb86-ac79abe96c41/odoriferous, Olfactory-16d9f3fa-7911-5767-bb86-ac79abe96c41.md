| source.excerpts.0.value | These consist of Nine Pairs or Sets .First pair , â   The Olfactory Nerves , arise by three medullary pedunculi , or roots , from the posterior parts of the CorÂ ¬ pora Striata , and Posterior and inferior parts of the Anterior Lobes of the CereÂ ¬ brum .The nerves emerge from the InÂ ¬ terstice between the Anterior and Middle Lobes of the Cerebrum called the Fissura Magna Sylvii , in the form of three peÂ ¬ dunculi or roots , and as they emerge , the pedunculi unite in substance . |

| source.excerpts.1.value | There are nine pair of Cerebral Nerves , or Nerves which arise from the Base of the Brain .The 1st pair , or Olfactory , are Nerves of a Peculiar Sense , giving the Sense of Smell to the Schneiderian Membrane of the Nose .2nd pair , or Optic Nerves , are nerves of a Peculiar Sense , â  ¢ giving the Sense of Sight to the Eye , in the form of the MemÂ ¬ braneous Retina , which is the expanded termination of the Optic Nerve , and the very seat of Vision . |

| source.excerpts.2.value | The nerves are then continued forwards , inclining a little inwards , in a plano - convex form ; the upper convex sides being lodged in suÂ ¬ perficial sulci in the under surface of the Anterior Lobes of the Cerebrum ; and their flat under - sides , being supported , first , upon the Alse Minores of the Sphce - noid Bone , and subsequently upon the Cribriform Plate of the ( Ethmoid Bone : as they are converging they gradually enÂ ¬ large in form ; and each ultimately ends in an oval - shaped and somewhat flatÂ ¬ tened extremity ; these extremities of the nerves , termed their Bulbous - shaped extreÂ ¬ mities , lie upon the Cribriform Plate of the ( Ethmoid Bone , laterally to the ProÂ ¬ cessus Cristatus , also to the anterior extreÂ ¬ mity of the Falx Major which is attached to the Processus Cristatus .From the under surfaces of these Oval or Bulbous - shaped Extremities , slender fasciculi or processes of their medullary substance , descend through the Foramina Cribrosa of the CribÂ ¬ riform Plate , where they pierce the Dura Mater , from which the fasciculi receive sheaths or external coats , so as to assume the structure of filaments ; and then deÂ ¬ scend in the form of two series of divergÂ ¬ ing filaments , between the Periosteum and the Schneiderian Membrane of the Nose ; one series upon the superior part of the Septum Nasi , or , upon the Nasal process of the ( Ethmoid Bone ; the other upon the Superior Turbinated Bone ; and as the filaments descend and gradually diverge , so they are insensibly lessened in size , unÂ ¬ til they are ultimately lost in the very subÂ ¬ stance of the Schneiderian Membrane , in which they lose their coats so as to be reÂ ¬ duced altogether to a medullary condition , whereby the medullary substance of the Olfactory Nerves in the seat of sense , is nearly in mechanical contact with the odoriferous particles floating in the Nares ; the outward surface of the Schneiderian Membrane being the only interception or intervening pelicle .As these filaments descend , they are insensibly diminished , by sending off innumerable and most minute filaments in lateral directions and in different degrees of obliquity , so as to intersect and to constitute a most delicate Rete Nervosum , or what may be termed , a Nasal P es - Anserinus , situated intermediÂ ¬ ately to the primary divergent filaments . |
