| source.excerpts.0.value | Far back down the ages , possibly about the time when the admirable Mr .Stephenson was busy practising with his locomotive , the _ Missa _ might have been a respectable ship , but her engines had been replaced so many times by others more pernicious and evil - smelling , and new boards had been nailed so frequently and promiscuously about the hull , that she resembled nothing so much as an aged female of indifferent repute decked in juvenile and unseemly clothes ; and her conduct matched her looks .Most men in the army will have noticed that the authorities nearly always order a move or begin a " show " on the day of rest . |

| source.excerpts.1.value | For the former there will be a convincing answer to their query ; the latter will have an opportunity of revising their notions as to what really constitutes a picnic .And we will start now , while the scent is hot , for already the infantry have begun their march and guns and waggons are rumbling along the roads from Suez to Kantara , the gate of the desert .CHAPTER IV KANTARA AND THE RAILWAY At this point it would be as well to confer with the map once more . |

| source.excerpts.2.value | For a few brief hours we could forget that our ultimate mission was to kill as many Turks as possible and could plod along on our horses as though all Time were our own , wanting nothing to our infinite content .An agreeable aroma hangs over the memory of that day though it was absolutely uneventful in itself .We arrived at our destination in a state of peace with all the world , which is a most inappropriate condition to be in for a soldier - - even amateurs like ourselves . |

| source.excerpts.3.value | In the springtime , if you turn your horse a mile or two away from the town an incomparable view is spread before your eyes .On every hand stretch the orange groves , great splashes of white and green , the scent from which is almost overpoweringly sweet .Here and there you see the darker green of the olive and the blazing scarlet of the pomegranate blossom , divided into patches by hedges of prickly pear ; and scattered about promiscuously are oleanders , cypresses , and the stately sycamores . |

| source.excerpts.4.value | In places the route was strewn with bones of horses and camels , while here and there a human arm or leg protruded from the sand , for the Turks did not dig very deeply , and the desert soon gives up its dead .At Romani especially the ground was littered with bones , great ravens hung over the putrifying bodies of animals , and a horrid , fetid smell pervaded the atmosphere .We were glad to get away from this Golgotha of the desert . |

| source.excerpts.5.value | Watering and feeding the horses was a horrible nightmare , but somehow it was done .The former was carried out by means of horse - buckets - - an interminable business , interrupted at frequent intervals when the men were shaken and torn by awful bouts of sickness as they staggered or crawled along the foul , evil - smelling hold .Feeding was rather easier and quicker , for there was little to give the poor brutes , even had they wanted it . |

| source.excerpts.6.value | It was a maddening business , this watering the horses .Poor brutes ! They would come in after a long day ' s trek , on short rations , with often a twenty - four hours ' thirst to quench , and then have to stand round a well and wait perhaps for hours ! Even the quietest of them began to fidget and strain at their head - ropes the moment they scented the water .As for the mules , there was simply no holding them . |

| source.excerpts.7.value | We knew what that meant .The assisting force would be sent to some evil - smelling native town with an unpronounceable name , miles from anywhere , left there to garrison the place and impress the inhabitants with the might of British arms , while the Cherif and his wild horsemen charged about the desert firing rifles in the air and emitting extraordinary yells to frighten away the few stray , half - starved Turks in the vicinity .And the prospect of travelling in a horse - boat down the Red Sea , even in November , did not appeal to us in the least . |

| source.excerpts.8.value | But the outstanding event of this period of waiting was the visit of one of Miss Lena Ashwell ' s concert parties to El Kubri .It will ever remain a fragrant memory , for it was the first time we had seen English ladies for nearly a year and it brought home very near to hear them sing .They gave their concert in a specially constructed " hall " in the desert . |

| source.excerpts.9.value | Hundreds of Turks wandered about , nominally prisoners , but with no one to guard them ; they were far more numerous than our own men ; and as the Turks generally had little idea of sanitation and less of personal cleanliness they were extremely unpleasant people to have about the place .There were no regrets at leaving Damascus , for though the odour of sanctity may hang over the venerable city , it is as naught compared with the other odours , of which it has a greater and more pungent variety than any city in the country .With the capture of Beyrout and Damascus hostilities had not ended , although the greater part of the Turkish Army had ceased to exist . |

| source.excerpts.10.value | Be pleased to imagine that we have trekked northwards from Suez , through the beautiful little town of Ismailia , " the emerald of the desert , " thence to Ferry Post , which was a position of considerable importance when the Turks attacked the Canal in February 1915 , and finally to Kantara , where we will pause to see if an answer can be found to the query propounded in the preceding chapter .If our inquiring friends had sailed down the Canal in 1915 they would have seen at Kantara - - had they noticed the place at all , which is unlikely - - a cluster of tents , a few rows of horse - lines , some camels , a white - walled mosque , and a water - tank close to the water ' s edge ; while their nostrils would have been pungently assailed by the acrid smell of burning camel - dung .It is at least probable that the last - named would have made the most striking impression . |

| source.excerpts.11.value | The army authorities had not yet adopted the Turkish idea of bivouac - sheets , two of which , buttoned together and propped up with a couple of poles , made an admirable shelter accommodating two persons .There are many worse things , however , than dropping gently to sleep in the open air with the faint scent from the almond - blossom titillating the nostrils .El Chauth at first sight appeared to be the kind of spot where every prospect pleases and only man is vile ; and as we had not had a really comprehensive wash for some considerable time and were very hairy withal , the adjective was aptly descriptive . |
