| source.excerpts.2.value | The Slaughter - houses , Cow - sheds and Bake - houses of the Parish are regularly inspected , and are kept in a 72 cleanly condition ; of the 19 Slaughter - houses , only 14 were re - licensed by the Magistrates , as the licenses were not applied for in 3 cases , and in two others the Metropolitan Board of Works successfully opposed the renewal of the licenses , because they were not constructed in accordance with the Bye - laws which the Board are empowered to enforce .The bad smells in Piccadilly and in Knightsbridge were complained of during the summer , but not to the same extent as in the preceding year ; I may add that Piccadilly has since been paved with wood , and that no smells along it have been complained of since , or perceived by me or by the Sanitary Inspectors ; this fact , I think , quite justifies the statement in my last Annual Report that the Piccadilly Sewer was not in fault , as was very generally supposed to be the case , but that the smells arose from the uncleanly condition of the roadway .The water supplied by the Grand Junction and Chelsea Water Companies was analysed from time to time , and found to be of average purity , except at the beginning of the year and in the month of November , when the filtration was inefficient on account of the heavy floods in the river . |
