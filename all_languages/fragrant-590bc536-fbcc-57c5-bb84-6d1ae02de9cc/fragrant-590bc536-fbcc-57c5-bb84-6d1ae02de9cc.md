| source.excerpts.0.value | Early in the afternoon we reached Wick , a seaport , and quite a considerable town in this far north country .It somewhat reminded me of Hammerfest , the most northern town of Europe , more especially the fishermen ' s quarters , which are pervaded by a perpetual smell of herrings as Hammerfest is by cod liver oil .The crow is apparently the sacred bird of Wick — on every chimneypot sat one , or sometimes sometimes a dozen . |

| source.excerpts.1.value | We went to evensong at St .Andrew ' s , a pretty Anglican church , but with the damp smell which seemed to pervade Fort William after the heavy rains .Monday was a lovely bright day . |

| source.excerpts.2.value | Nor was she by any means the only offender .I lingered behind in the Chapel to enjoy the fragrance of the cedar wood with which it is panelled .We wondered at Verrio ' s ceilings , and at the treasures of Art and learning , contained in the picture and sculpture galleries , and in the great Library . |

| source.excerpts.4.value | I could not help feeling amused , while at the same time I reflected how sad it is that we cannot agree to differ .Why should not Puritans consent to allow us , who delight in gorgeous ceremonial , fragrant clouds of incense lights , music , colour , flowers in shrines — Where the shrill bell rings , the censer swings , And solemn chants resound to enjoy the services we prefer , without furiously raging against us ? In our turn why should we object to their worshipping in unadorned simplicity ? I know still many excellent people who would cheerfully burn one alive for the good of one ' s soul and expect one to feel obliged to them .All religious intolerance is odious . |
