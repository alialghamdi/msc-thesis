| source.excerpts.0.value | The Armenians call that Plant Badisamour , but one of them very rationally told me , that they had no reason to give it the name of that Pestiferous Wind , and far less to attribute to it the cause of the bad effects thereof , seeing the same Plant is found in many places , where the Badisamour Wind rages not ; as at Lar , and beyond it , and that Wind rages only from Conveston to Bender ; Nay many people of Schiras told me that the Plant is to be found two Leagues from that Town , where that Wind rages not , and I have seen it in many places upon the Road from Carzerum to Benderick .This is a good reason to prove that that Plant causes not the aforesaid Wind , but it does not sufficiently prove , that with that Wind it does not cause these bad effects ; for it may very well be said , that if that hot Wind reigned in places where there were no such Plant , it would not , perhaps , be so mortal , because it may be , that being already very bad of it self , the malignity of it is encreased by passing over these Plants , whose smell and noxious qualities it carries along with it ; but what in my opinion , may serve to convince us of the contrary ; betwixt Mosul and Bagdad there being no such Plants , ( at least I never saw , nor heard there were any ) the Wind which in those quarters is called the Samiel is as pestiferous and mortal there , as in the places where that Plant is to be found ; it is therefore impertinent to attibute to it the bad effects of that Wind , and the rather that that Plant grows all over the Indies , where it is not known what the Wind Samiel is .Besides what the Armenian told me that that Plant is called Kerzehreh , that is to say , Asses - Gall , for the reason alleadged before , I found in a Dictionary Turkish and Persian , that Kerzehreh signifies besides , a Tree of Poyson , and that man as ∣ sured me that it was Poysonous , if but smelt too . |

| source.excerpts.1.value | There are thirteen Baths in Tunis , where all the Slaveslodge , except those that are kept in their Masters Houses , and ( as several Slaves told me ) there may be there in all ten or twelve thousand Christian Slaves , who carry every one a great ring of Iron at their foot , Knights of Malta at Tunis but the Knights of Malta have besides that a huge Iron - Chain above five and twenty pound weight , which is fastened to the Ring , that Chain is very troublesome to them , for they must either turn it quite round their Leg and make it fast there , which is very heavy when they walk , or hang it by a hook that they have by their side , which commonly gives them a pain in the side , or else must carry it on their Shoulders .In these Baths there is a great Hall where they are shut up in the Night - time , there they lodge as well as they can , some having little Rooms made of wood , to which they go up by Ladders , and are stowed three or four together in one , the rest lye upon the Ground , but all horridly bad , for being very numerous , and lock ' d in in the Night - time , they do their needs where they are in Pots , which raises a noysome stench ; besides when one has a mind to sleep , some fall a talking , and others a quarelling and fighting , making constantly a hideous din , which seems to me a Hell upon Earth .In the morning this Prison is opened , and those that are to work , are let out , who are conducted to their Labour by men that take care of it ; they are employed in building and other works of that nature ; and I have known Knights of Malta of noble Families there , who have been made serve as Labourers , some carrying Sand and others Stone , and they were thus used to oblige them to ransom themselves the sooner , and at the higher rate . |
