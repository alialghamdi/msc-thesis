| source.excerpts.7.value | As for my Part , I believe the Exhalation it self , which comes out of the Ground , is not always of the same Kind , being at one time slack , and at another strong and vigorous ; and the Truth of that Experi ∣ ment , which I use to prove it , is attested by several Strangers , and by all those which serve in the Temple .For the Room where those do wait who come for An ∣ swers from the Oracle , is sometimes , though not often , and at certain stated times , but as it were by Chance , filled with such a fragrant Odour and Scent , that no Perfumes in the World can exceed it , and this arises as it were out of a Spring , from the Sanctuary of the Temple .And this proceeds very likely from its Heat , or some other Power or Faculty which is in it ; and if per ∣ adventure this seems to any Body an unlikely thing , however such a one will allow , that the Prophetess Py ∣ thia hath that Part of the Soul , unto which this Wind and Blast of Inspiration approacheth , moved by variety of Passions and Affections , sometimes after one sort , and sometimes another ; and that she is not always in the same Mood and Temper , like a sixt and immutable Harmony , which the least Alteration or Change of such and such Proportions destroys . |
