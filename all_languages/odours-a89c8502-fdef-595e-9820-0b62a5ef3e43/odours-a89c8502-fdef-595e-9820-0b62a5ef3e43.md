| source.excerpts.1.value | After many disappointments and unsuccessful attempts to obtain the vegetable I wished , I succeeded , by artificial means frequently employed , in growing a small vegetable , combining the flavour of a delicate cream with the piquancy of lemon .The most difficult part of my task had however not been accomplished , namely , to give to the vegetable all the aromatic and stimulating flavours of the prohibited spices .A fine specimen of the seed of each of the spice plants having been procured , I took from the heart of each seed the smallest possible particle , and , having with the greatest care made an incision in one of the finest seeds of my new vegetable , I inserted therein one specimen of each of these minute particles . |
