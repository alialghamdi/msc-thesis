| source.excerpts.1.value | The air was steaming with delightful fragrance , not rising and wafting past in separate masses , but diffused through all the atmosphere .Pine woods are always fragrant , but most so in spring when the young tassels are opening and in warm weather when the various gums and balsams are softened by the sun .The wind was now chafing their innumerable needles and the warm rain was steeping them . |

| source.excerpts.2.value | The winds flow in melody through their colossal spires , and they are vocal everywhere with the songs of birds and running water .Miles of fragrant ceanothus and manzanita bushes bloom beneath them , and lily gardens and meadows , and damp , ferny glens in endless variety of fragrance and color , compelling the admiration of every observer .Sweeping on over ridge and valley , these noble trees extend a continuous belt from end to end of the range , only slightly interrupted by sheer - walled cañons at intervals of about fifteen and twenty miles . |

| source.excerpts.4.value | Sauntering in any direction , hundreds of these happy sun - plants brushed against my feet at every step , and closed over them as if I were wading in liquid gold .The air was sweet with fragrance , the larks sang their blessed songs , rising on the wing as I advanced , then sinking out of sight in the polleny sod , while myriads of wild bees stirred the lower air with their monotonous hum - - monotonous , yet forever fresh and sweet as every - day sunshine .Hares and spermophiles showed themselves in considerable numbers in shallow places , and small bands of antelopes were almost constantly in sight , gazing curiously from some slight elevation , and then bounding swiftly away with unrivaled grace of motion . |

| source.excerpts.5.value | Very old trees are usually dead at the top , the main axis protruding above ample masses of green plumes , gray and lichen - covered , and drilled full of acorn holes by the woodpeckers .The plumes are exceedingly beautiful ; no waving fern - frond in shady dell is more unreservedly beautiful in form and texture , or half so inspiring in color and spicy fragrance .In its prime , the whole tree is thatched with them , so that they shed off rain and snow like a roof , making fine mansions for storm - bound birds and mountaineers . |

| source.excerpts.6.value | I made my bed in a nook of the pine - thicket , where the branches were pressed and crinkled overhead like a roof , and bent down around the sides .These are the best bedchambers the high mountains afford - - snug as squirrel - nests , well ventilated , full of spicy odors , and with plenty of wind - played needles to sing one asleep .I little expected company , but , creeping in through a low side - door , I found five or six birds nestling among the tassels . |

| source.excerpts.7.value | It was still early morning when I found myself fairly adrift .Delicious sunshine came pouring over the hills , lighting the tops of the pines , and setting free a steam of summery fragrance that contrasted strangely with the wild tones of the storm .The air was mottled with pine - tassels and bright green plumes , that went flashing past in the sunlight like birds pursued . |

| source.excerpts.8.value | The rain brought out the colors of the woods with delightful freshness , the rich brown of the bark of the trees and the fallen burs and leaves and dead ferns ; the grays of rocks and lichens ; the light purple of swelling buds , and the warm yellow greens of the libocedrus and mosses .The air was steaming with delightful fragrance , not rising and wafting past in separate masses , but diffused through all the atmosphere .Pine woods are always fragrant , but most so in spring when the young tassels are opening and in warm weather when the various gums and balsams are softened by the sun . |

| source.excerpts.9.value | We hear much nowadays concerning the universal struggle for existence , but no struggle in the common meaning of the word was manifest here ; no recognition of danger by any tree ; no deprecation ; but rather an invincible gladness as remote from exultation as from fear .I kept my lofty perch for hours , frequently closing my eyes to enjoy the music by itself , or to feast quietly on the delicious fragrance that was streaming past .The fragrance of the woods was less marked than that produced during warm rain , when so many balsamic buds and leaves are steeped like tea ; but , from the chafing of resiny branches against each other , and the incessant attrition of myriads of needles , the gale was spiced to a very tonic degree . |

| source.excerpts.11.value | Winds are advertisements of all they touch , however much or little we may be able to read them ; telling their wanderings even by their scents alone .Mariners detect the flowery perfume of land - winds far at sea , and sea - winds carry the fragrance of dulse and tangle far inland , where it is quickly recognized , though mingled with the scents of a thousand land - flowers .As an illustration of this , I may tell here that I breathed sea - air on the Firth of Forth , in Scotland , while a boy ; then was taken to Wisconsin , where I remained nineteen years ; then , without in all this time having breathed one breath of the sea , I walked quietly , alone , from the middle of the Mississippi Valley to the Gulf of Mexico , on a botanical excursion , and while in Florida , far from the coast , my attention wholly bent on the splendid tropical vegetation about me , I suddenly recognized a sea - breeze , as it came sifting through the palmettos and blooming vine - tangles , which at once awakened and set free a thousand dormant associations , and made me a boy again in Scotland , as if all the intervening years had been annihilated . |

| source.excerpts.12.value | Then the Yosemite Valley was discovered , and thousands of admiring tourists passed through sections of the lower and middle zones on their way to that wonderful park , and gained fine glimpses of the Sugar Pines and Silver Firs along the edges of dusty trails and roads .But few indeed , strong and free with eyes undimmed with care , have gone far enough and lived long enough with the trees to gain anything like a loving conception of their grandeur and significance as manifested in the harmonies of their distribution and varying aspects throughout the seasons , as they stand arrayed in their winter garb rejoicing in storms , putting forth their fresh leaves in the spring while steaming with resiny fragrance , receiving the thunder - showers of summer , or reposing heavy - laden with ripe cones in the rich sungold of autumn .For knowledge of this kind one must dwell with the trees and grow with them , without any reference to time in the almanac sense . |

| source.excerpts.14.value | Monardella grows here in large beds in the openings , and there is plenty of laurel in dells and manzanita on the hillsides , and the rosy , fragrant chamoebatia carpets the ground almost everywhere .These , with the gums and balsams of the woods , form the main local fragrance - fountains of the storm .The ascending clouds of aroma wind - rolled and rain - washed became pure like light and traveled with the wind as part of it . |

| source.excerpts.15.value | It is not long , geologically speaking , since the first raindrop fell on the present landscapes of the Sierra ; and in the few tens of thousands of years of stormy cultivation they have been blest with , how beautiful they have become ! The first rains fell on raw , crumbling moraines and rocks without a plant .Now scarcely a drop can fail to find a beautiful mark : on the tops of the peaks , on the smooth glacier pavements , on the curves of the domes , on moraines full of crystals , on the thousand forms of yosemitic sculpture with their tender beauty of balmy , flowery vegetation , laving , plashing , glinting , pattering ; some falling softly on meadows , creeping out of sight , seeking and finding every thirsty rootlet , some through the spires of the woods , sifting in dust through the needles , and whispering good cheer to each of them ; some falling with blunt tapping sounds , drumming on the broad leaves of veratrum , cypripedium , saxifrage ; some falling straight into fragrant corollas , kissing the lips of lilies , glinting on the sides of crystals , on shining grains of gold ; some falling into the fountains of snow to swell their well - saved stores ; some into the lakes and rivers , patting the smooth glassy levels , making dimples and bells and spray , washing the mountain windows , washing the wandering winds ; some plashing into the heart of snowy falls and cascades as if eager to join in the dance and the song and beat the foam yet finer .Good work and happy work for the merry mountain raindrops , each one of them a brave fall in itself , rushing from the cliffs and hollows of the clouds into the cliffs and hollows of the mountains ; away from the thunder of the sky into the thunder of the roaring rivers . |

| source.excerpts.17.value | Then the flat scales open and the seeds take wing , but the empty cones become still more beautiful and effective , for their diameter is nearly doubled by the spreading of the scales , and their color changes to a warm yellowish - brown ; while they remain swinging on the tree all the following winter and summer , and continue effectively beautiful even on the ground many years after they fall .The wood is deliciously fragrant , and fine in grain and texture ; it is of a rich cream - yellow , as if formed of condensed sunbeams ._ Retinospora obtusa , Siebold _ , the glory of Eastern forests , is called " Fu - si - no - ki " ( tree of the sun ) by the Japanese ; the Sugar Pine is the sun - tree of the Sierra . |

| source.excerpts.20.value | He seems , however , to prefer those of the two Silver First above all others ; perhaps because they are most easily obtained , as the scales drop off when ripe without needing to be cut .Both species are filled with an exceedingly pungent , aromatic oil , which spices all his flesh , and is of itself sufficient to account for his lightning energy .You may easily know this little workman by his chips . |

| source.excerpts.22.value | The floating grass panicles are scarcely felt in brushing through their midst , so flue are they , and none of the flowers have tall or rigid stalks .In the brightest places you find three species of gentians with different shades of blue , daisies pure as the sky , silky leaved ivesias with warm yellow flowers , several species of orthocarpus with blunt , bossy spikes , red and purple and yellow ; the alpine goldenrod , pentstemon , and clover , fragrant and honeyful , with their colors massed and blended .Parting the grasses and looking more closely you may trace the branching of their shining stems , and note the marvelous beauty of their mist of flowers , the glumes and pales exquisitely penciled , the yellow dangling stamens , and feathery pistils . |

| source.excerpts.23.value | When in full bloom , a single tree seems to be visited at times by a whole hive of bees at once , and the deep hum of such a multitude makes the listener guess that more than the ordinary work of honey - winning must be going on .How perfectly enchanting and care - obliterating are these withdrawn gardens of the woods - - long vistas opening to the sea - - sunshine sifting and pouring upon the flowery ground in a tremulous , shifting mosaic , as the light - ways in the leafy wall open and close with the swaying breeze - - shining leaves and flowers , birds and bees , mingling together in springtime harmony , and soothing fragrance exhaling from a thousand thousand fountains ! In these balmy , dissolving days , when the deep heart - beats of Nature are felt thrilling rocks and trees and everything alike , common business and friends are happily forgotten , and even the natural honey - work of bees , and the care of birds for their young , and mothers for their children , seem slightly out of place .To the northward , in Humboldt and the adjacent counties , whole hillsides are covered with rhododendron , making a glorious melody of bee - bloom in the spring . |

| source.excerpts.24.value | Thus every snow - bound bird seemed more or less uncomfortable if not in positive distress .The storm was reflected in every gesture , and not one cheerful note , not to say song , came from a single bill ; their cowering , joyless endurance offering a striking contrast to the spontaneous , irrepressible gladness of the Ouzel , who could no more help exhaling sweet song than a rose sweet fragrance .He _ must _ sing though the heavens fall . |
