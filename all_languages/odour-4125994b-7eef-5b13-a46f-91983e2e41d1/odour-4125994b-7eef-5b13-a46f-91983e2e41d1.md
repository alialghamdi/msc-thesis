| source.excerpts.3.value | A well - known perfume manufacturer at Cannes uses annually 140 , 000 lbs .of rose leaves alone , and other perfume - laden flowers in proportion .It is remarkable that the perfumes obtained from these flowers are the types of nearly all flower orders ; thus , if wo blend jasmine and orange , the result is a scent like sweet pea ; when jasmine and tuberose are mixed , the perfume is that of the hyacinth ; violets and tuberoses resemble lily of the valley . |

| source.excerpts.5.value | THE use in medicine of the rose dates from a very remote period .Theophrastus , who flourished in the fourth and third centuries before the Christian era , speaks of roses being of many kinds , including some with double flowers , which were the most fragrant ; and he also alludes to their use in the healing art .Succeeding writers of every age , down to a recent period , have discussed the virtues of the rose , and although it is scarcely admitted now to possess any special medicinal properties , its beauty remains unchallenged . |

| source.excerpts.6.value | The natives are very fond of using the rose - water as medicine , or as a vehicle for other mixtures , and tbey consume a good deal of the petals for the conserve of roses , or gool - kand as they call it .The delightful fragrance from the Ghazipur rose fields can be scented at seven miles ' distance on the river Ganges .The chief locality for attar of roses , and that by which European commerce is almost exclusively supplied , is a small tract of country on the southern side of the Balkan Mountains in the Turkish province of Rocundia . |

The chemist may not say , " I will give you a draught and charge you sixponce for it , " but we presume he might say , in common with any other of his fellow creatures , " I would advise you to purchase 40 drops of compound aromatic spirit of ammonia , 20 drops of spirit of chloroform , 2 drachms of compound tincture of cardamoms , and 13 drachms of camphor mixture ."

| source.excerpts.12.value | According to Schering ' s statement , as this chloroform ( after purification by standing on sodium and subsequent distillation ) contained no acetole , there should have been no formation of phosgene gas .In another experiment a bottle partly filled with absolutely pure chloroform was placed in the sunlight ; in a very short time it had undergone decomposition , and an unmistakable smell of phosgene gas was noticed .Schacht concludes that pure chloral chloroform is a body exceedingly sensitive to the action of light , * and contains the elements of decomposi - tion a short time after it is prepared , even if alcohol be added to it . |

| source.excerpts.15.value | The iron of commerce contains more or less carbon in two different conditions â   as carbide of iron ( FeC 4 ) , and as graphitoid carbon , and we might therefore expect to have the latter at least left behind upon solution of the iron .If some varieties of white cast iron be used , and the acid be strong , no residue is left , both the conditions of carbon becoming converted into volatile hydrocarbons ; but with ordinary iron wire it is found that the carbon present as carbide is entirely volatilised as the hydro - carbons previously referred to , and forms an oily layer on the surface of the liquid , having a composition similar to that of petroleum , and a very disagreeable odour .The graphitoid carbon , on the other hand , is left in hard scales . |
