| source.excerpts.0.value | That is the way in which the perception of a particular object is formed — by the association of all the sensations which it is adapted to excite in our different senses , their combination in what we call an idea .For example , in the idea of an orange are combined the sensations which we get by tasting it , by touching it , by smelling it , by looking at it , by handling it , each sensation having been acquired by its particular sense in the course of an education which has been going on ever since we were born ; when we have got them in that way , they combine to form the idea of the orange ; and it is by virtue of this idea , which has been formed and registered in the mind , that we are able to think of an orange , that is , to form a mental image of it , when it is not present to any sense , and to recognize it instantly when it is .It is plain , then , how large a part , by virtue of its past experience , the mind contributes to each perception ; when we look at an orange it tacitly supplies to the impression which it makes on sight all the information about it which we have got at different times by our other senses , and which sight does not in the least give us ; the visual impression is no more in truth than a sign to which experience has taught us to give its proper meaning , just as the written or spoken word in any language is a sign which is meaningless until we have been taught what to mean by it . |

| source.excerpts.5.value | When , however , a person has hallucinations that are utterly inconsistent with the observation and common - sense of the rest of mankind ; when he cannot correct the mistakes of one sense by the evidence of another , although every opportunity is afforded him to do so ; when he believes in them in spite of confuting evidence , and when he suffers them to govern his conduct , then he must certainly be accounted insane : he is so much out of harmony of thought and feeling with his kind that we cannot divine his motives or reckon upon his conduct , and are compelled to put him under restraint .Persons of this class are apt to be troublesome and even dangerous ; believing that they are pursued by a conspiracy , hearing the threatening voices of their persecutors wherever they go , seeing proofs everywhere of their evil machinations , smelling poisonous fumes , feeling the torture inflicted by concealed galvanic wires , they endeavor to protect themselves by all sorts of devices — appeal to the magistrates and the police for assistance , become public nuisances in courts of justice , are , perhaps , driven at last , either from despair of getting redress , or by the fury of the moment , to attack some one whom they believe to be an agent in the persecution which they are undergoing .Some of them hear voices commanding them peremptorily to do some act or other — it may be to kill themselves or others — and they are not unlikely in the end to obey the mysterious commands which they receive . |

So we need not be surprised to find that the delicate fragrance of peaches , strawberries , oranges , and pineapples , is a guide to their edibility , and a foreshadowing of their delicious flavor , leading us on by an instinctive action to place the savory morsels between our lips .But the greatest need of all , if the plant would succeed in enticing the friendly parrot or the obsequious lemur to disperse its seed , is that of conspicuousness . |

| source.excerpts.8.value | Yet it must be remembered that the earliest fruit - eaters , though they might find the scarlet , crimson , or purple coats of their food an aid to discrimination in the primeval forests , would not necessarily derive any pleasure from the stimulation thus afforded That pleasure has been slowly begotten in all frugivorous races by the constant use of these particular nerves in the search for food , which has at last produced in them a calibre and a sensitiveness answering pleasurably to the appropriate stimulation .Just as the peach , which a dog would reject , has become delicious to our sense of taste ; just as the pineapple , at which he would sniff unconcernedly , has become exquisite to our sense of smell — so the pure tints of the plum , the orange , the mango , and the pomegranate , which he would disregard , have become lovely to our sense of color .And , further still , just as we transfer the tastes formed in the first two cases to the sweetmeats of the East , or to the violets , hyacinths , and heliotropes of our gardens , so do we transfer the taste formed in the third case to our gorgeous peonies , roses , dahlias , crocuses , tiger - lilies , and chrysanthemums ; to our silks , satins , damasks , and textile fabrics generally ; to our vases , our mosaics , our painted windows , our frescoed walls , our Academies , our Louvres , and our Vaticans . |

| source.excerpts.13.value | Nevertheless , his life was made miserable by them ; he would not go into society , but took solitary rambles in the country , where he might meet as few persons as possible ; in his own house he slept for the first part of the night on the ground - floor , mounting up higher at a later period of the night ; and this he did to prevent the bad odors from becoming too concentrated in one room .He believed that the people in the next house were irritated and offended by the emanations , for he often heard them moving about and coughing ; and , when he passed a cab - stand in the street , he noticed that even the horses became restless and fidgeted .He used to hang his clothes out of the window at night that they might get pure , until his housekeeper put a stop to the practice by telling him that the exhibition of them would excite the notice and comment of his neighbors . |

With all that money , " the representative American would say , " I could keep a yacht , and a stud of fast horses , and build a church , and endow a college , and send a dozen missionaries to the heathen , and run a whole political campaign at my own expense ; and you say this odd creature actually spent life in the smudge and stenches of a chemical laboratory , puttering with gases , and worried about the composition of the air ! " We do not here exaggerate the vulgar passion of Americans for money , and their relative and consequent indifference to other things .The country does not breed Cavendishes , and , if one should appear , he would stand a first - rate chance of getting into a lunatic asylum , as the bare fact of his indifference to riches would be held as prima - facie evidence of an unsound mind ! The science that gives promise of immediate results , that can be turned into money , is appreciated ; that which aims only at the extension of scientific truth wins little support . |

| source.excerpts.27.value | I cannot , of course , enumerate all the bodily conditions in which hallucinations appear , but there is one more which I shall mention particularly , because it has been the foundation of a prophetic or apostolic mission .It is not at all uncommon for a vivid hallucination of one or other of the senses , of hearing , of sight , of smell , of touch , of muscular sensibility , to precede immediately the unconsciousness of an epileptic fit .It may be a command or threat uttered in a distinct voice , or the figure of a person clearly seen , or a feeling of sinking into the ground or of rising into the air ; and a common visual hallucination on such occasions is a flash , a halo , or a flood of bright or colored light , which makes a strong impression before the person falls unconscious . |

| source.excerpts.28.value | Thus , if there were but five simple characters in such a world , we might denote them by A , B , C , D , E , and their negatives by a , b , c , d , e ; and then , as there would be 25 or 32 different combinations of these characters , completely determinate in reference to each of them , that world would have just 32 objects in it , their characters being as in the following table : Table I .ABCDE AbCDE aBCDE abCDE ABCDe AbCDe aBCDe abCDe ABCdE AbCdE aBCDE abCdE ABCde AbCde aBCde abCde ABcDE AbcDE aBcDE abcDE ABcDe ABcDe aBcDe abcDe ABcdE AbcdE aBcdE abcdE ABcde Abcde aBcde abcde   For example , if the five primary characters were hard , sweet , fragrant , green , bright , there would be one object which reunited all these qualities , one which was hard , sweet , fragrant , and green , but not bright ; one which was hard , sweet , fragrant , and bright , but not green ; one which was hard , sweet , and fragrant , but neither green nor bright ; and so on through all the combinations .This is what a thoroughly chance - world would be like , and certainly nothing could be imagined more systematic . |

| source.excerpts.31.value | All last year — perhaps for many years before — the hyacinth - leaves were busily engaged in assimilating nutritive matter from the air about them , none of which the plant was then permitted to employ in the production of a blossom , but all was prudently treasured up by the gardener ' s care in the swelling bulb .This year , enough nourishment has been laid by to meet the cost of flowering , and so our hyacinth is enabled to produce , through its own resources , without further aid from the sun , its magnificent head of bright - colored and heavily - scented purple bells .Each species of plant must , of course , solve for itself the problem , during the course of its development , whether its energies will be best employed by hoarding nutriment for its own future use in bulbs and tubers , or by producing richly - endowed seeds which will give its offspring a better chance of rooting themselves comfortably , and so surviving in safety amid the ceaseless competition of rival species . |

Mr .McCook , member of the Academy of Natural Science of Philadelphia , has made sundry experiments which appear to show that difference of odor constitutes the means of discrimination .Of course , it is not possible to demonstrate this hypothesis directly by showing the existence , either of distinct odors , or of different intensity of odor , in opposing hosts . |
