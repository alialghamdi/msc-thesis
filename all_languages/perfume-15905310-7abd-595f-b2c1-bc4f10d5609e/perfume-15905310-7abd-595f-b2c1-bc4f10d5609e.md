' He replied , that the stinks were not quite sufficiently defined to sketch , he should hire a boat and bathe and , having purchased a couple of oyster - cloths , the nearest approximation he could find to towels , so indeed he did , leaving me ( incapable of natation ) , to contemplate the Garrison , an extensive pUe with a very military and practical look , Spike Island , once the residence of Mr .Mitchell , and now occupied by some 2000 malefactors of less illustrious name , and Rocky and Hawlbotvline Islands , which are used as ammunition stores . |

The Gap of Dunloe is a wUd ravine , a defile through the mountains ( on the right are the Reeks , and on the left thc Tomies , Glena , and the Purple Mountain ) , which , rising on either side , dark , stern , and sterile , with no great interval between , impart a solemn grandeur to tbe Pass .The river Loe flows beneath the huge blocks of stone which have fallen from tbe rocks above â   PREFATORY . |
