| source.excerpts.0.value | Here it is done by hereditary custom , guiltless of theory ; and perhaps , by the still surviving influence of some ancient religion .In spite of dying cats and dogs , and refuse of various kinds , and the total absence of street - wardens , Aleppo has , on the whole , a sweet - smelling atmosphere , more like to an English country town than to a city .I can only attribute this to the thinness of population in it . |

| source.excerpts.1.value | How their lungs manage to exhaust so long a tube , I cannot understand .Unless it be overdone , I think the exercise from early youth must enlarge the capacity and power of the lungs ; and I beg you to suggest this to the patrons of artificial gymnastics ! gymnastics ! For the NargiU and Hooka , they are fond of mixing into the tambac various conserves , as rose paste and other perfumes , and alas ! opium ; to what extent the last , I do not know .But the tambac is always wet with something . |
