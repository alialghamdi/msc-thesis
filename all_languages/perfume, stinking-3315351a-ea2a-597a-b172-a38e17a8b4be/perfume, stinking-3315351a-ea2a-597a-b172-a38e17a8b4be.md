Twas here that I recower ' d life , 93 CALLIOPE Then Flora , who trampled me under her feet , In gay colours danc ' d over the ground ; And yet , my olfactory senses to greet , Shed the balm of sweet odours around ! And she call ' d the gay Nymphs that attend in her train , In colours so variously drest , And , doffing the white shroud wherein I was slain , They danc ' d a quadrille on my breast ! And they took it in turn to figure away , As their shewing off season came round : While lady Arundo soft music did play , And Diana beat time on the ground ! Now Thetis was taller than all the rest , And her weight I with agony bore ; When she stamp ' d the blood flovv ' d up in my chest , As the tide rises up on the shore ; But my heart was of rock in a mountain dell , Whence torrents of liquid did flow ; And the girls as they waltz ' d and sipp ' d at the well , More blooming , and fresher did grow ! Galanthis , the fair , in a robe of white , As modest as colourless snow , With Primula , footed left hand and right , On the frolic fantastical toe : Daffodilla , the next , wras a gaudy Miss , With a yellow vest and a green gown ; And she fled just to give Hyacinthus a kiss , And nodded her jealous head down ! For she view ' d her fair rival step up by her side , Scilla gracefully vested in blue , Whom Narcissus and Crocus had claim ' d for a bride , 78 HARMONY OF THE MUSES If Lawrence could hug the hot iron , I wist That my fate I should fearlessly meet ; But in pity I beg you , since suitor and saint Carry crosses of different wood , To spare me this trial ; for truly I faint With the pressure of dear flesh and blood .Remonstrance was useless , the lady was firm , I struggled in vain to get free , Till agony left me a lesson to learn — That a martyr I never could be ! So I answered — the truth shall be faithfully told , I will number the catalogue true , From the damsel who first did my passion unfold , To the love now exhausted in you ! My first was Fortuna in infancy wild , And upon me she carelessly sat , Found me yet but a fanciful prurient child , Who scarcely knew what to be at . |
