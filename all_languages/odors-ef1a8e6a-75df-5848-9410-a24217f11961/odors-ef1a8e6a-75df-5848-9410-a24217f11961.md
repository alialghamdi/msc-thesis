| source.excerpts.1.value | Most of the vegetable odors are caused by vegetable matter in solution .Brown - colored waters invariably have a sweetish - vegetable odor , and the intensity of the odor varies almost directly with the depth of the color .Both color and odor are due to the presence of certain glucosides , of which tannin is an example , extracted from leaves , grasses , mosses , etc . |

| source.excerpts.3.value | It is not surprising , either , that the Synura should have been overlooked in the water , because the organ - ism disintegrates readily and a comparatively small number of colonies are able to produce a considerable odor .The times of the occurrence of the odor - namely , in the spring and autumn - are worth noting , as they correspond with the seasons when Synura grows best and when it is most com - monly found .In February , 1892 , the cucumber taste again appeared in the Boston water . |

| source.excerpts.6.value | This is supported by the fact that , when the organisms do decay , the bacteria increase in number and the odor of the water changes in character .The natural odor is given off by some substance inside of the organism , and when this substance becomes liberated the odor is more easily detected .The odor is intensified by heat - ing by mechanical agitation , and by change in the density of the water containing the organisms . |

| source.excerpts.7.value | In some cases the oily compounds have been isolated by extraction with ether or gasoline .Odors due to these oils have been called ' ' odors of growth " because the oils are produced during the growth of the organisms .The oil - globules may be seen in many genera if they are examined with a sufficiently high power . |

| source.excerpts.74.value | In many cases where a peculiar odor of a water has been charged to some of these littoral forms , subsequent investigation has made it probable that the odor was really caused by limnetic organisms that had been overlooked in the first instance .Speaking generally it may be said that in reservoirs that are large and deep the organisms attached to the shores pro - duce little or no effect on the odor of the water ; and that in small shallow reservoirs where the aquatic vegetation is thick they do not impart any characteristic " natural " odor , but they may produce a sort of vegetable taste and a disagreeable odor due to decomposition .Some of the littoral aquatic plants , such as Myriophyllum and a number of the filamentous alga , possess a natural odor that is strongly " vegetable " and , at times , almost fishy ; but the odor is obtained only when the plants are crushed or when fragments are broken off and scattered through the water Under ordinary conditions of growth in a reservo , r this does not happen and therefore no odor is imparted to the water except through decomposition . |
