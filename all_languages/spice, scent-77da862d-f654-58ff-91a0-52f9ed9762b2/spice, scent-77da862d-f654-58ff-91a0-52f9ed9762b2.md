| source.excerpts.2.value | When the Corcyraeans applied to Athens for assistance against Corinth , one of their main argu - ments was that hostilities between the rival con - federacies could not be postponed much longer .Pericles doubtless foresaw this when by his advice a defensive alliance was contracted with the Cor - cyraeans , and ten galleys sent to assist them , under Lacedaemonius the son of Cimon , which were only to be brought into action in case a der scent upon the territories of the Corcyraeans were threatened .Plutarch represents Pericles as send - ing so small a force through jealousy of the family of Cimon . |
