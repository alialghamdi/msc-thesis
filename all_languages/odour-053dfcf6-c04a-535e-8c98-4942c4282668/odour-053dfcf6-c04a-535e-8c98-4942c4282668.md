To rise in the blue crepuscular light , with the early birds just stirring in their nests and heard behind the unshuttered windows , and emerge from the deep convent porch into the dew - washed country , following and followed by all the town , walking in two long lines , widely apart , behind the priests in their stoles and surplices , and chanting solemn Latin hymns ! It was a rich Norman land we wandered along , now by glittering rills , with the smell of violets in the air , by narrow green paths through the newly ploughed earth , while the mounting sun cast joy into our faces , warming the chill spring wind , and provoking the birds to rival our hymns with their clearer and sweeter notes ; then through continents of apple bloom , whole lakes above of pink - white blossoms on either side , with rivulets of upper blue seen through the tracery of foamy waves .Who , watching that solemn procession of amiable enthusiasts , chanting hymns to God and beseeching Him with confidence and fervour to bless the earth and all its produce , — wheat , wine , fruit , and flower , the water we drink , and the grass we tread upon , — could smile or carp at the sprinkling of the ground , of trees , of river - * bed with holy water ? There was something deeply impressive in the hymns sung at that early hour , while the towns still slept and the French schooldays , whereas the Corpus Christi procession was but a scorching misery ! To rise in the blue crepuscular light , with the early birds just stirring in their nests and heard behind the unshuttered windows , and emerge from the deep convent porch into the dew - washed country , following and followed by all the town , walking in two long lines , widely apart , behind the priests in their stoles and surplices , and chanting solemn Latin hymns !
