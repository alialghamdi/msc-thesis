That these low forms of animal life may seriously affect the blood of the higher orders of animals is clearly proved by the recent researches of Davaine , who has furnished us with the first well - established example of a disease of the blood due to the presence of inferior beings which are capable of development and multiplication in the torrent of the circulation . |
