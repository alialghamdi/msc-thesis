This operation is probably performed in the time of expiration , because it is said that this wâ   ater is sometimes very offensive ; but all this I only give as conjecture . |

| source.excerpts.330.value | The organ of smell is out of the direct road of the current of air in inspiration ; it is also out of the current of water when they spout ; may we not suppose then , that this sinus contains air , and as the water passes in the act of throwing it out , that it impregnates this reservoir of air , which immediately affects the sense of smell ? This operation is probably performed in the time of expiration , because it is said that this wâ   ater is sometimes very offensive ; but all this I only give as conjecture .If the above solution is just , then only those which have the organ of smell can spout , a fact worthy of inquiry .The organ of smell would appear to be less necessary in these ani - mals than in those which live in air , since some are wholly deprived of it ; and the organ in those which have it is extremely small , when compared with that of other animals , as well as the nerve which is to receive the impression , as was observed above ^ . |
