Some of the Turkish tombs are very elaborate and beautiful , particularly in the solemn Necropolis of Scutari : there are none of the prettinesses of Pere - la - Chaise to be found amid its wide solitudes ; and it is equally free from colossal statues of statesmen , looking as though they had been transplanted from a council - chamber or a cathedral , and appalling representations of grinning skele - tons and eyeless sculls ; no fanciful calembourgs on roses and reine - marguerites are graven into the eternal stone , which had been better enshrined in some gilded volume : â   all is stern , and still , and solemn : the fatuities of life have no place in that city of the dead ; its very atmosphere is unlike that which is breathed elsewhere , for the clustering together of the cypresses diffuses a strong aroma of resin , purifying the air , and counteracting the pernicious effects of such a mass of perishing mortality as that which lies below ; while its deep shadows , and its occasional gleams of light falling upon the myriad liead - stones scattered around , are like glimpses of an unknown world .Those head - stones themselves form a striking and peculiar feature of the scene ; they are extremely picturesque and various in design ; and as the Musselmauns never disturb the ashes of the dead , and never bury and re - bury on the same spot , as is too commonly the case in the more narrow and confined grave - yards of Europe , the time - worn , weather - stained , and leaning column , beneath which the clammy human soil has failed , is seen in juxta - position with the brightly - gilded , fresh - lettered pillar of yesterday , against which time has yet had no power , and over which no storm - cloud has yet burst , standing turban - crowned and erect , telling its tale of recent bereavement .",

        "value": "The Tobacco Bazar is a very important feature in the Tcharchi ; the quantity consumed yearly in the city being immense , and the qualities numerous .Those most esteemed , however , are from Salonica and Latakia ; the former by the women , from its mildness and perfume , and by the more luxurious among the men ; and the latter by the lower classes , on account of its great strength .Other varieties from the Crimea , Ormus , and many parts of the East , and also from Hungary , are in abundance ; and when it is remembered that in Constan - tinople a visit is never paid , a bargain is never negociated , an hour is never passed , without the eternal chibouque , there will be no necessity for the assurance that this is the most bustling of all the bazars .",
