| source.excerpts.0.value | Pliny refers to Egyptian sesame oil .3 Uses of Oils and Fats Oils and fats were employed in ancient Egypt for eating ; cooking and illumination ; for anointing both the living and the dead ; for libations ; as a base for perfumes ; as medicines and vehicles for medicines and doubtless for many other purposes .In addition to the large local supply , oil was also imported from abroad to some extent from an early period and to an increasing extent later , thus in the Eighteenth Dynasty there are records of oil having been brought from Naharin , 4 Retenu 5 and Zahi , 6 all in western Asia , and in the Twentieth Dynasty from Syria . |

| source.excerpts.11.value | 5 Banks and Hilditch point out that the results found make it most improbable that any of the specimens had originally been castor oil , which previous to their work had been suggested for three specimens ( once by Friedel , once by Thomas and once by the author ) , since the principal constituent of castor oil is a variety of oleic acid ( in the combined state ) and since the oleic acid , which must have been contained in all the other specimens ( oleic acid being a constituent of most fixed oils and solid fats , particularly the former ) had wholly or largely disÂ ¬ appeared .The strong smell , reminiscent of rancid coconut oil , frequently noticed in the ancient fatty materials , has led to the suggestion that the original fat had been coconut oil , 5 and the presence of palmitic acid has been taken to indicate an original palm oil , 5 but both these suppositions are demonstrably wrong , the smell being due to a very small proportion of nonoic acid , which 1 A .Banks and T . |
