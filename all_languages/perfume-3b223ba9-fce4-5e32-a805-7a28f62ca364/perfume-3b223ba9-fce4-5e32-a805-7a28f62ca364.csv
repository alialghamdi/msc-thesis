Some of the Turkish tombs are very elaborate and beautiful , particularly in che solemn Necropolis of Scutari : there are none of the prettinesses of Pere - la - Chaise to be found amid its wide solitudes ;

no fanciful calembourgs on roses and reine - marguerites are graven into the eternal stone , which had been better enshrined in some gilded volume - .— all is stern , and still , and solemn : the fatuities of life have no place in that city of the dead ; its very atmosphere is unlike that which is breathed elsewhere , for the clustering together of the cypresses diffuses a strong aroma of resin , purifying the air , and counteracting the pernicious effects of such a mass of perishing mortality as that which lies below ; while its deep shadows , and its occasional gleams of light falling upon the myriad head - stones scattered around , are like glimpses of an unknown world .Those head - stones themselves form a striking and peculiar feature of the scene ; they are extremely picturesque and various in design ; and as the Musselmauns never disturb the ashes of the dead , and never bury and re - bury on the same spot , as is too commonly the case in the more narrow and confined grave - yards of Europe , the time - worn , weather - stained , and leaning column , beneath which the clammy human soil has failed , is seen in juxta - position with the brightly - gilded , fresh - lettered pillar of yesterday , against which time has yet had no power , and over which no storm - cloud has yet burst , standing turban - crowned and erect , telling its tale of recent bereavement .","strong","the","aroma","of resin","its very atmosphere","purifying the air","http://data.odeuropa.eu/source/1644fe8e-1747-5846-86e3-b503d322018d/fragment/26d05fec-4793-5879-bf5f-92d18455ed24","The Tobacco Bazar is a very important feature in the Tcharchi ;
