| source.excerpts.0.value | The residence of the favourite and the courtier is indeed a wide extensive over whose front is besprent a deal of gilding , and various The lattices of the harem are gaily painted , the terraces are bright with flowers , the marble steps against which the blue ripple chafes in the sunshine are thronged with attendants , and the caique that awaits its owner at their base is like a fairy bark , glittering with gold and crimson .Arabesques adorn the walls , and pretty kiosques peep from among the leaves of the tall trees of the extensive gardens ; the perfume of flowers and the sounds of music come blended along the water , and the very atmosphere breathes prosperity .The discarded Bey and the disgraced Minister boast dwellings as stately and as proud , but the trace of change is over all . |

| source.excerpts.1.value | The entire building is painted in white and pale gold ; and it has rather the appearance of a fairy - palace , called into existence by enchantment , than the mere every - day work of human hands .A marble gate , terminating the terrace in the direction of the city , admits the visitor into a garden bright with flowers , and redolent of perfume ; where fountains fountains for ever fling their delicate jets of water against the sky , with a soft and soothing music well suited to the spot ; and where birds of gorgeous plumage wander at will , as rainbow - tinted as the blossoms amid which they sport .A line of gilt lattices veils the seaward boundary of this delicious retreat ; and , passing beside these , an inlaid door of stately proportions gives admittance to the Hall of Entrance . |

| source.excerpts.2.value | It is overshadowed by two of the most majestic maple - trees in the city , whose gnarled and knotted trunks and fantasticallytwisted fantasticallytwisted branches bespeak them of a date coeval with that of the gleaming temple which they so greatly embellish .Beneath their long cool shadows congregate groups of idlers , attracted thither by the calm stillness and refreshing breezes ; and there they loiter for hours , erecting in the court their awnings of striped cotton , and spreading their mats for the mid - day siesta ; while the melon and sherbet - venders ply their fragrant trade , and the perfumed vapour of the Salonica tobacco exhales from many a chibouque .The court of Yeni Djami generally presents the characteristic scene which I have here described ; and of the mosque itself , the Turks have a popular tradition , tradition , that it was built from the produce of one of the Sultana - mother ' s diamondstudded diamondstudded slippers , piously disposed of for the purpose of its erection ; a legend which doubtlessly owes its origin to the probable fact of the expenses having been defrayed from the bishmalik ( or slipper - money ) of the imperial lady — i national grant to the female members of the reigning family , bearing some analogy to the privy purse in England . |

| source.excerpts.3.value | These houses have many of them terraces overlooking the cemetery , — gay with flowers , loud with laughter , and bright with smiles : trees have been planted before them ; cafes , where the young and the idle congregate during the summer evenings to enjoy their ices and cigars , awaken with their light revelry the echoes of the death - place ; and many a fond couple wander away amid the graves , and sit hand in hand upon some lettered stone , to exchange their vows , and to lay plans for the future on the very threshold of the past ! Some of the Turkish tombs are very elaborate and beautiful , particularly in che solemn Necropolis of Scutari : there are none of the prettinesses of Pere - la - Chaise to be found amid its wide solitudes ; and it is equally free from colossal statues of statesmen , looking as though they had been transplanted from a council - chamber or a cathedral , and appalling representations of grinning skeletons skeletons and eyeless sculls ; no fanciful calembourgs on roses and reine - marguerites are graven into the eternal stone , which had been better enshrined in some gilded volume - .— all is stern , and still , and solemn : the fatuities of life have no place in that city of the dead ; its very atmosphere is unlike that which is breathed elsewhere , for the clustering together of the cypresses diffuses a strong aroma of resin , purifying the air , and counteracting the pernicious effects of such a mass of perishing mortality as that which lies below ; while its deep shadows , and its occasional gleams of light falling upon the myriad head - stones scattered around , are like glimpses of an unknown world .Those head - stones themselves form a striking and peculiar feature of the scene ; they are extremely picturesque and various in design ; and as the Musselmauns never disturb the ashes of the dead , and never bury and re - bury on the same spot , as is too commonly the case in the more narrow and confined grave - yards of Europe , the time - worn , weather - stained , and leaning column , beneath which the clammy human soil has failed , is seen in juxta - position with the brightly - gilded , fresh - lettered pillar of yesterday , against which time has yet had no power , and over which no storm - cloud has yet burst , standing turban - crowned and erect , telling its tale of recent bereavement . |

| source.excerpts.4.value | The Tobacco Bazar is a very important feature in the Tcharchi ; the quantity consumed yearly in the city being immense , and the qualities numerous .Those most esteemed , however , are from Salonica and Latakia ; the former by the women , from its mildness and perfume , and by the more luxurious among the men ; and the latter by the lower classes , on account of its great strength .Other varieties from the Crimea , Ormus , and many parts of the East , and also from Hungary , are in abundance ; and when it is remembered that in Constantinople Constantinople a visit is never paid , a bargain is never negociated , an hour is never passed , without the eternal chibouque , there will be no necessity for the assurance that this is the most bustling of all the bazars . |

| source.excerpts.5.value | There are the remains of a lofty and handsome gate - way , and the disposition of the masonry is highly extoUed by architects ; but to the mere tourist , the ruined Palace of Constantine , reft of its old - world associations , is possessed of little interest ; and that bttle is absolutely negatived by the price which he is compelled compelled to pay for a visit to its neighbourhood .To all oriental travellers it will be sufficient to state that the building has been given up to the Jews as a pauper - hospital , for them to understand at once that it is almost unapproachable , being the head - quarters of filth , and the hotbed of pestilence , where every sense is pained by scents and sights calculated to inspire dread and disgust .Masses of the fallen masonry cumber the foundations of the ruin , and every niche is abve with its noisome tenant ; here it is a sallow and fleshless crone , whose lean and shrivelled hands can with difficulty disengage themselves from 43 MOSQUE OF SULTANA VAL1DE . |

| source.excerpts.6.value | None but opulent Turks frequent this establishment , the expense of the enter tainment being considerable .Small brazen censers , placed on the summit of pyramidal flower - stands , and constantly burning , filled the apartment with the perfume of sandal - wood , benzoin , and wood of aloes , intermingled with the rich odours of Indian myrtle , jasmine , and other rare or sweet plants .In establishments , such as the one here described , the most rare and costly coffee and tobacco is served to the guests , by the owner of the house ; but in the common run of Coffee - kiosques , each individual brings his own tobacco in a small bag , which he carries amid the folds of the shawl that he wears about his waist , or , should he have adopted the new costume , in his bosom . |

| source.excerpts.7.value | What the public baths are to the women of Turkey , the public coffee - houses are to their lords — the head - quarters of gossipry , and news , and enjoyment — where every passing event is canvassed , and weighed , and judged ; and time is suffered to slide by as carelessly as though it might one day be redeemed .In the villages , the Coffee - Kiosques are erected in pleasant shady nooks , where the maples shed a glory and a grace over the hamlet , ( for these are never wanting in a village on the Bosphorus ; ) and where , with the leaves above their heads , canopied by the bright blue sky which peeps in among them as if to lend them an added beauty , and the flowing at their feet , the placid and nature - loving Moslems inhale the fragrance of the chibouque , and drain their tiny cups of scented mocha .But in the city , few are the coffee - kiosques which can boast better shade than that of the deeply projecting roof of the building , which , flung boldly forward several feet from the walls of the house itself , serves to shelter the open terrace that stretches along each side of the edifice ; and this terrace , furnished with wide seats , on which the visitor can lounge at ease , forms the nearest approach to out - of - door enjoyment compatible with their situation . |

| source.excerpts.8.value | Other varieties from the Crimea , Ormus , and many parts of the East , and also from Hungary , are in abundance ; and when it is remembered that in Constantinople Constantinople a visit is never paid , a bargain is never negociated , an hour is never passed , without the eternal chibouque , there will be no necessity for the assurance that this is the most bustling of all the bazars .The narghile , or water - pipe , which is seldom used until after the mid - day meal , and which greatly resembles the hookah of Hindostan , is always filled with Shiraz tobacco , sprinkled with rose - water , and frequently rendered still more odoriferous by having a scented pastile placed on its summit , while the water through which the vapour passes is impregnated with the perfume of some flower or spice .The Spice Bazar is perhaps , however , the most perfectly oriental department of the Tcharchi ; for it is laden and groaning with all the costly condiments of the Levant , in enormous quantities . |

| source.excerpts.9.value | A few Genoa velvets and European satins may be found in the bales of the merchants ; but as they are comparatively unsaleable , the Frank lady who seeks them has no opportunity of being fastidious in her selection .The Confectionary Bazar is also extremely well worthy of a visit , for the Orientals excel in all the delicate preparations of sugar and perfume which can be produced .Preserved rose - leaves — a feast for the fairies — look as bright , as soft , and almost as sweet , as though they had just been shaken to the earth by a truant zephyr wandering in the gardens of Nishapor ; gums , mixed with sugar , perfumes , and the juices of fruits , are moulded into a hundred pretty shapes , and may be purchased of as many different flavours ; cakes of sherbet - paste , casks of chalva , ( a composition of flour , honey , and oil , ) delicate sweetmeats from Smyrna and Scio , and strings of sausages , hung in festoons , and filled with the inspissated juice of grapes , mixed with walnuts or almonds , are among the most popular articles of the sekeljhes , * if we except , indeed , the ka ' imac , or clotted cream , which is also sold in this bazar . |

| source.excerpts.10.value | If a stranger approach to examine the wares of the hadji , it is curious to witness the interest which every individual takes in the success of his trade .The lookerson lookerson will seize a chaplet of Arabian wood , rub it rapidly in their hands , and hold it towards him , that he imy inhale its perfume , expatiating all the time on its extreme extreme sweetness ; while exclamations of Guzel ! peh guzel ! — good ! very form a perfect chorus : or they will smear their beards with dye to convince him of its efficacy , if by these means they can induce the sale of any of the scattered articles about them .Nor are they fastidious in their commercial notions , for they stand quietly ancl encouragingly by , while the wily hadji cheats the unclean giaour , without evincing any inclination to rescue the victim ; and as he bears away some treasure , for which he has probably paid about five times its value , the worthy Moslems see him depart with an ejaculation of Allah buyuk der — God is and then calmly resume the chibouque and the narration where each had been interrupted . |

| source.excerpts.11.value | The Confectionary Bazar is also extremely well worthy of a visit , for the Orientals excel in all the delicate preparations of sugar and perfume which can be produced .Preserved rose - leaves — a feast for the fairies — look as bright , as soft , and almost as sweet , as though they had just been shaken to the earth by a truant zephyr wandering in the gardens of Nishapor ; gums , mixed with sugar , perfumes , and the juices of fruits , are moulded into a hundred pretty shapes , and may be purchased of as many different flavours ; cakes of sherbet - paste , casks of chalva , ( a composition of flour , honey , and oil , ) delicate sweetmeats from Smyrna and Scio , and strings of sausages , hung in festoons , and filled with the inspissated juice of grapes , mixed with walnuts or almonds , are among the most popular articles of the sekeljhes , * if we except , indeed , the ka ' imac , or clotted cream , which is also sold in this bazar .The name ka ' imac , signifying in the Turkish language the excess of excellence , will give some idea of the estimation in which this dainty is held by the natives ; and , truly , it deserves the appellation it has obtained , for there are few edibles in the luxurious East more delicate than the kaimac . |

| source.excerpts.12.value | Sophia , like that of every other mosque in the city , is paved with marble , and shaded by magnificent plane - trees , whose far - spreading branches and luxuriant fobage chequer the vast space with alternate patches of light and shadow , which produce a fine effect ; and collect in the vicinity of the holy edifice groups of quiet - looking Moslems , who spread their carpets , and seat themselves to smoke their chibouques , and watch the pious who pass into the temple from sunrise to sunset .An elegant fountain , with a projecting octagonal roof , whose marble basin is screened by a covering of iron net - work from the pollution of the birds which swarm upon the roof and amid the intricacies of the building , affords to the Faithful the necessary opportunity of performing their preliminary ablutions ere they enter the mosque ; while in its immediate vicinity , amulet and scent merchants , merchants , generally hadjis or pilgrims , with their green turbans and flowing beards , spread their mats , and expose for sale all descriptions of chaplets , perfumes , relics from Mecca , charms against the Evil Eye , amber and ivory mouth - pieces for the chibouque , and dyes and toys for tbe harem .As these pilgrim - merchants are generally gifted with a quiet facetiousness of manner which never fails to amuse a Turk , they collect about them numbers of idlers , whose picturesque costume and graceful attitudes form at every moment studies for the painter : the tall Effendi , with his turban of cachemire and his furred pelisse , stands beside the red - capped and blue - coated soldier ; while , squatted at their feet , pipe in hand , and passing the beads of his tusbee * listlessly through his fingers as he intently follows the discourse which is going on around • Chaplet . |

| source.excerpts.13.value | There is a marked difference in the method of smoking pursued by the upper class of Turks and that practised by the poorer orders .The wealthy and fastidious fastidious Effendi fills the boudaka * of his chibouque with the mild and costly tobacco of Salonica , which he inhales , until round the edges of the bowl a circle of white ash is formed , which rises buoyantly from the superincumbent morsel of heated charcoal , when he immediately empties the boudaka , and flings the exhausted weed away , for its aroma has then perished , and the tobacco , to a connoisseur , has become worthless ; while the boatmen and mechanics smoke the strong , coarse produce of Latakia , even to the last fragment .There are other varieties of the scented imported from the Crimea , Ormus , Circassia , ■ md different parts of the East , but the two already quoted are by far the most popular , and the most extensively consumed . |
