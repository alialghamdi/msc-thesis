| source.excerpts.0.value | â   My reply to his criticism on our tripartite division of the senses elicited a cordial acceptance of the explanation .That explana - tion was as follows : â   Smell , taste , and touch involve contact with the object itself that is perceived , no matter how finely divided it may be , as in the case of smell ( which entirely does away with Professor Jagerâ   s hypothesis , which represents the fallacy of mistaking the infini - tesimally small material for the spiritual , dematerialisation being an altogether different thing from minute subdivision ) .The other two senses , sight and hearing , involve contact , not with the object itself that is perceived , but with vibrations set up by that object in an intervening medium , such as the luminiferous ether , or the atmosphere . |

" The beautiful old priory here is an object of interest .There is an aroma to me of sanctity about it still .I will send with this a copy of the little guide , which may amuse Mrs Kingsford if she has leisure to read the rigmarole concerning the famous alchemist . |

| source.excerpts.2.value | Such an apophthegm , for instance , as that which follows the verse just quoted , is so sublimely true that it matters little whether the physiological analogon that underlies it is a trias or a pentas .â   Have you ever heard of Professor Jagar in Stuttgart , who has written a book on the discovery of the soul , and who tries to prove that the sense of smell is the highest , most refined , and immaterial of all the senses , and that , if a soul could be physically perceived , it would be through that sense alone ? From a purely scientific and â   astral â   point of view , the olfactory perception is a most mysterious phenomenon , since it reveals to us matter so highly attenuated that ^ I .e . |

| source.excerpts.3.value | How can poets endure Rome ? No art , no marble or painted or columned beauty , can compensate for the daily sight and hearing of the devilries of Italian peasants .And the priests ! Pah ! They resemble black flies buzzing about the putrid corpse of a dead rehgion .Florence is sweeter and wholesomer than Rome , because , I suppose , it has not been cursed with direct papal govern - ment . |

| source.excerpts.7.value | Mr Ruskin has said that the criterion of a beautiful action or of a noble thought is to be found in song , and that an action about which we cannot make a poem is not fit for humanity .Did he ever apply this test to flesh - eating ? Many a lovely poem , many a beautiful picture , may be made about gardens and fruit - gathering , and the bringing home of the golden produce of harvest , or the burden of the vineyards , with groups of happy boys and girls , and placid , mild - eyed oxen bending their necks under their fragrant load .But I defy anyone to make beautiful verse or to paint beautiful pictures about slaughterhouses , running with streams of steaming blood , and terrified , struggling animals felled to the ground with poleaxes ; or of a butcherâ   s stall hung round with rows of gory corpses , and folks in the midst of them bargaining with the ogre who keeps the place for legs and shoulders , SOME FORMER INCARNATIONS 249 and thighs and heads , of the murdered creatures ! What horrible surroundings are these for gentle and beautiful ladies ! The word â   wife â   means , in the old Saxon tongue , a â   weaver â   ; and that of â   husband â   means , of course , a â   husbandman . |

| source.excerpts.8.value | D .Before me the roses are blooming In glory of crimson and snow , Their petals the soft air perfuming With fragrance above and below ; A HOME TO DIE IN 349 Athwart the dark blue of the mountain The red dawn is stealing on high .And spreading its crimson - rayed fountain Far up through the pale eastern sky . |

| source.excerpts.9.value | â   Then shall be the Sabbath of the Lord God .â   The other was suggested by the periods assigned to Esther , and to herself as her representative : â   â   Six years shall she be anointed with oil of myrrh ; that is , with study and training , severe and bitter : â   And six years with sweet perfumes ; that is , with the gracious loveliness of the imagery and poetry of the faiths of the past , that religion may not be lacking in sweetness and beauty .â   ^ Such was precisely the number of years that she would have then been occupied in her spiritual work with me , and such also the periods of their division ; so that , whether as applied to the term of her life or her work , the prognostics would fit the actual periods in the event of a near breakdown . |

| source.excerpts.10.value | We wondered what sort of persons they had been in the habit of dealing with who would be taken in by such a palpable device , and were disposed to resent the implied imputation on our own want of percipience .No special illumination was vouchsafed to guide our decision , but we took the following experience as pointing in the same direction : â   Being attacked by a bad fit of asthma one day while conversing with our hostesses , Mary begged for a whiff of chloro - form to allay it , which she duly took , with the result desired , I meanwhile being somewhat uneasy as to what she might be prompted to say while under its influence .For she had never been lucid in the presence of anyone save myself . |

| source.excerpts.11.value | And it came to us both simultaneously , and was comprised in the word â   Karma .â   In recounting to Mary her horoscope , we were reminded it had been said to her , â   It was fore - ordained that you should be luxurious , and addicted to the use of all manner of sweet and cleanly perfumes , baths , and anointments , which render the body fragrant and pure .You will , there - fore , in opposing your destiny , be extraordinarily apt to contract all manner of such filthy complaints as accompany poverty , dirt , and the reverse of the condition to which your Rulers destined you . |

| source.excerpts.12.value | Must we send to the slaughter - yard our aged and infirm horses and other beasts of burden who have spent their whole lives in our service , and whose very decrepitude is owing to the toil we have exacted of them ? Old men look forward to a calm decease in the midst of tenderness and love , surrounded by those for whose benefit they have laboured , and in whose arms they hope to pass away .But the old and faithful dumb servant , whose neck is worn with the yoke and whose knees are bent and weak with the long years of painful and constant work , falls murdered under the blows of the axe in a miserable and foul - smelling den , where often he is starved and wasted for many days before this horrible and ungrateful end .Is it right that violent death should be the reward of so great service ? These questions must all be answerable in a satisfactory manner ; otherwise I see no alternative but to drop the thread which , so far , I have unravelled from the tangled skein , and confess with the Agnostics that one can know nothing . |

I hear the waves break on the headland ; beyond is white mist , beautiful , soft , diaphanous .You cannot tell where the sea ends and the mist begins . |
