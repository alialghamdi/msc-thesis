| source.excerpts.1.value | " I ' d stay at home , I think , if I was silly enough to be afraid of a harmless caterpillar like that , " Fanny had said , as with her own hands she took from Lucy ' s curls and threw away a thousand - legged thing , the very sight of which made poor Lucy shiver but did not send her to the house .She was too much interested and too eagerly expectant of what the afternoon would bring , and so she perched herself upon the fence where nothing but ants could molest her , and finished the bouquets which Fanny hung upon the trees until the lower limbs seemed one mass of blossoms and the air was filled with the sweet perfume .Lucy was bewitchingly beautiful that afternoon in her dress of white , her curls tied up with a blue ribbon , and her fair arms bare nearly to the shoulders . |

| source.excerpts.2.value | Everything wore its brightest aspect .The windows of the little parlor were open , and the songs of birds and the perfume of flowers were wafted through them .But the little breakfast - table , with its snowy cloth and its one plate , cup and saucer , looked almost piteous from its solitude . |

| source.excerpts.3.value | Then , sitting in his easy - chair , and moving the lamp nearer to him , he took Mrs .Meredith ' s letter and broke the seal , starting as if a serpent had stung him when , in the note inclosed , he recognized his own handwriting , the same he had sent to Anna when his heart was so full of hope as the brown stalks now beating against his windows with a dismal sound were full of fragrant blossoms .Both had died since then - - the roses and his hopes - - And Arthur almost wished that he , too , were dead when he read Mrs . |

| source.excerpts.4.value | " That Mr .Leighton should bring her niece a book did not seem strange at all , but that he should be so very thoughtful as to tell Esther to take it to her room struck her as rather odd , and as the practiced war - horse scents the battle from afar , so Mrs .Meredith at once suspected something wrong , and felt a curiosity to know what the book could be . |

| source.excerpts.5.value | There is some great mistake , " Anna found strength to say , and then she lay back in her easy - chair panting for breath , her brain all in a whirl as she thought of the possibility that she was once so near the greatest happiness she had ever desired , and which was now lost to her forever .He brought her smelling salts , he gave her ice - water to drink , and then , kneeling beside her , he fanned her gently , while he said : " There surely is a mistake , and , I fear , a great wrong , too , somewhere .Were all your servants trusty ? Was there no one who would withhold a letter if he had written ? Were you always at home when he called ? " Thornton questioned her rapidly , for there was a suspicion in his mind as to the real culprit ; but he would not hint it to Anna unless she suggested it herself . |
