| source.excerpts.7.value | The failing , if characteristic of lord Kames , was not unusual at the period , and is one which time , and the advantage of the labours of previous thinkers , tend to modify ; in the work we are just considering , the line of argument maintained bids defiance to the adoption of any one general principle , while much confusion is prevented , by the author having given a definition of what he understands those laws of nature to which he refers our consciousness of good and evil to consist of .Although the author in the advertisement avows the purpose of his work to be " to prepare the way for a proof of the existence of the Deity , " and terminates the whole with a very pious and orthodox prayer , he had the fortune to bring the church of Scotland like a hornet ' s nest about him , on the ground of certain principles tending to infidelity , which some of its active adherents had scented out in his arguments .A zealous clergyman of the name of Anderson published , in 1753 , " An Estimate of the Profit and Loss of Religion , personally and publicly stated ; illustrated with references to Essays on Morality and Natural Religion ; " " in which the unfortunate philosopher is treated with no more politeness than the opponent of any given polemical disputant deserves . |

| source.excerpts.14.value | Another point urged is that all possible sensations of colour , tone , temperature constitute groups of qualitative continua .This applies to cases where the changes are made by imperceptible gradations ; while the transitions that are in their nature abrupt , as the change from a smell to a taste , or from sweet to bitter , constitute a distinct class .The hypothetical explanation of the last is a higher degree of complexity . |

| source.excerpts.15.value | That man has fewer instincts than the brutes and that even these few can be easily led astray , may be explained from the great preponderance of the brain in his case .The sense of beauty which instinctively guides the selection for the satisfaction of sexual passion is led astray when it degenerates into the tendency to pederasty ; analogous to the fact that the blue - bottle ( Musca vomitoria ) , instead of depositing its eggs , according to instinct , in putrefying flesh , lays them in the blossom of the Arum dracunculus , deceived by the cadaverous smell of this plant .Now that an instinct entirely directed to that which is to be produced lies at the foundation of all sexual love will receive complete confirmation from the fuller analysis of it , which we cannot therefore avoid . |
