| source.excerpts.596.value | The reason of this is that , in pressing upon the nail , you press likewise the flesh , which be - comes whiter by the pressure , because the red particles of blood which filled its transparent vessels , and made it appear red , are thereby repelled .If , instead of pressing the upper part of the nail , you press its sides , in the same NAL [ 245 ] NAR manner as we press certain snuff - boxes to open them , the nail then grow red all along its middle , from its top down to the white speck at the root of it , while the sides in the meantime be - come pale and white .The cause of this pheno - menon is that , by squeezing the sides of the nail in this fashion , they press harder upon the flesh , while the back of the nail , on the contrary , is raised more into an arch , and thus the flesh is more at liberty under the back of the nail than under its sides , whence it must necessarily happen , in the manner above explained , that the middle of the nail must grow red , and its sides appear pale . |
