| source.excerpts.0.value | But the colour is mixed up indiscriminately with the colours of many other berries , nor should I be able to distinguish it among them .The smell of a brick - kiln carries the evidence of its own identity with it : neither is it to me ( from peculiar associations ) unpleasant .The colour of brickdust , on the contrary , is more common , and easily confounded with other colours . |

| source.excerpts.1.value | There was a little parish church near , but tall elms and quivering alders hid it from my sight , when , all of a sudden , I was startled by the sound of the full organ pealing on the ear , accompanied by rustic voices and the willing choir of village maids and children .It rose , indeed , “ like an exhalation of rich distilled perfumes .” The dew from a thousand pastures was gathered in its softness ; the silence of a thousand years spoke in it . |

| source.excerpts.6.value | Shakespear says , It has been observed in explanation of this passage , that it is because in the day - time lovers are occupied with one another ’ s faces , but that at night they can only distinguish the sound of each other ’ s voices .I know not how this may be : but I have , ere now , heard a voice break so upon the silence , and charm the moonlight air with its balmy essence , that the budding leaves trembled to its WHY DISTANT OBJECTS PLEASE .229 accents . |

| source.excerpts.7.value | of flattery has been avoided , we still find in how very few instances the best painters produce a likeness up to the life , though practice and interest join in the attempt .“ I imagine an ordinary person would find it very difficult , supposing he had some knowledge of drawing , to afford from memory a tolerable sketch of such a familiar object as his curtain , his carpet , or his dressing - gown , if the pattern of either be at all various or irregular ; yet he will instantly tell , with precision , either if his snuff or his wine has not the same character it had yesterday , though both these are compounds .“ Beyond all this I may observe , that a draper who is in the daily habit of such comparisons cannot carry in his mind the particular shade of a colour during a second of time ; and has no certainty of tolerably matching two simple colours , except by placing the patterns in contact . |

| source.excerpts.8.value | It is clear I must have seen as well as tasted those things ; and I am decided that I remember the tastes with more precision than I do the visual sensations .“ I remember having once , and only once , eat Kangaroo in New Holland ; and having once smelled a baker ’ s shop having a peculiar odour in the city of Bassorah .Now both these gross ideas remain with me quite as vivid as any visual ideas of those places ; and this could not be from repetition , but really from interest in the sensation . |

| source.excerpts.10.value | After observing , a little before , that “ nothing is more untrue than that sensations of vision do necessarily leave more vivid and durable ideas than those of grosser senses , ” he proceeds to give a number of illustrations in support of this position .“ Notwithstanding , ” he says , “ the advantages here enumerated in favour of sight , I think there is no doubt that a man will come to forget acquaintance , and many other visible objects , noticed in mature age , before he will in the least forget taste and smells , of only moderate interest , encountered either in his childhood or at any time since .“ In the course of voyaging to various distant regions , it has several times happened that I have eaten once or twice of different things that never came in my way before nor since . |
