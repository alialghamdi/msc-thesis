| source.excerpts.0.value | In several instances comfort has been derived from the use every night of a pessary containing extract of logwood and cocoa - butter ( thirty grains of each ) ; an application , the power of which is not deteriorated by having combined with it belladonna or morphia .And , lastly , I have known ladies attempt to prevent the foetid smell from being perceptible to others by padding the vulva with small muslin bags of vegetable charcoal j a practice which is only of any value in ex - ceptional cases and under peculiar circumstances .Now the measures which have just been described may be said to be those which are to be practised in almost every instance of uterine cancer ; and it is certain that by their skilful adaptation to the exigencies of each particular case much good may be done . |
