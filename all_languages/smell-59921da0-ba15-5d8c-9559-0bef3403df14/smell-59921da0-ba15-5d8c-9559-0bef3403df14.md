| source.excerpts.0.value | â   Early in the month of May , 1910 , all the diseased box - meat , which had been placed in a large store on the east side of the works , was removed at the instance of the Sanitary Inspector , and the store thoroughly cleansed and limewashed .Since that time no offensive smells could arise from this source .Other alterations of an extensive nature were also made in these works during last summer , but it has become obvious that offensive smells are still felt in the area outside of these works , and therefore must have an origin other than that due to the storing of the box - meat . |

| source.excerpts.1.value | In order to discover whether the existence of these offensive smells outside of the works was of frequent occurrence , a careful watch has been made by the Inspectors attached to the Department from the 1st of May last down to Saturday , the 19th of November , the Inspectors being instructed to pay surreptitious visits to these works on week - days , and also , if necessary , on Sundays .We append to this report a note * of the dates of these visits , along with the Inspectorâ   s report upon the direction of the wind on each occasion , and whether any smell was observed outside to the leeward of the works .From this it will be noted that , in all , the Inspectors made 107 observations at varied periods and at differing hours , and found smells of varying degree issuing outside of the works on 45 occasions . |

| source.excerpts.3.value | With regard , however , to those which are associated with the processes carried on at the tallow melting works , repeated visits have convinced me that the method of handling the residue of the digesters is defective .The digesters are three in number , and the smells are most likely to arise when they are being emptied of their solid contents , and during its subsequent handling .During the visit formerly referred to , we were assured that the temperature of the solid contents of the digesters , after removal of the fats , was invariably lowered by the introduction of cold water , but it is obvious that efficiency in carrying out this instruction will depend on the care of the individual workman who executes it . |

| source.excerpts.19.value | It will be convenient here to refer to my former report to the Board ( of 14th July , 1910 ) in order to adopt a description of the works at Coventry Drive contained therein .In the Spring of 1910 , complaint regarding this work had been frequent , and there is little doubt that whatever portion of the smells at that time arose from trade processes , it was greatly accentuated by the presence of a large quantity of unwhole - some box meat which was then being stored without any satisfactory provision for dealing with the effluvia therefrom .The removal of this had been accomplished before my report of July was submitted , but I then expressed the opinion that the apparatus for drying the solid residue of the digesters seemed to me to be defective , and a possible source of much smell . |

| source.excerpts.25.value | * The impression prevailing as to the cause of the nuisance at this period would appear to have been that the distillery effluent in cooling as it ran along the sewer deposited solid material , and underwent some chemical change which gave rise to the smells complained of .It would then seem to have occurred to those who were dealing with the matter that some provision for more effectively cooling the effluent before discharge from the distillery tank system would tend to lessen the amount of deposit in the sewer , and consequently the source of the smells complained of , and the Manager of the distillery , writing to the Town - Clerk on 12th October , 1906 , makes the following observations : â   â   We are pushing on the alterations connected with the better settling of our â   spent wash and washings , and these are to be composed of two large vats and â   six square brick tanks â   three of the latter in a row .We will discharge into â   the first one , and allow it to flow from same to the second , and then to the â   third , so as to allow time for settling and cooling , using the different sets â   alternately , whereby we expect to be able to pass the waste into the sewers â   much fresher and quicker , and give less time for any chance of decomposition â   and without any solid matter whatever . |

| source.excerpts.26.value | It will be observed that the sewers draining Ardmore Street , Coventry Drive , Culloden Street , Crinan Street , and Staftâ   a Street all communicate with this large sewer , and consequently are open to receive the naphthalene and other gases which were emitted from the Alexandra Park sewer , and which were so much complained of by the residenters in Kennyhill Gardens and Staffa Street .We have no doubt , therefore , that the complaints we have received of offensive odours in Ardmore Street , Culloden Street , and Coventry Drive have a similar origin , and are not connected with the Tallow Melting Works in question , the effluents from which , as will be observed from the plan , flow in an opposite direction , through the 4 feet barrel sewer which discharges into the Alexandra Parade sewer at Armadale Street â   a considerable distance to the west .On visiting the works themselves we at once felt the effluvium whenever we entered the yard , as it seems to cling to the walls , and is never absent inside a work of this description . |

| source.excerpts.27.value | The combination of the steam boiler furnaces with the thorough oxidation of such organic effluvia is not altogether satisfactory , as when the steam pressure in the boiler becomes excessive , and steam is blown off through the safety valves , the fireman naturally ceases to fire his furnaces , so as not to maintain a higher temperature therein than is necessary to keep the steam at a working pressure , and is thus apt to forget that his furnaces are also called upon to operate as fume cremators .In these circumstances , and to avoid further complaints from this source , it will be necessary - that representations should be made to the firm either to erect a special furnace for the purpose of thoroughly destroying , at all times , all offensive vapours which arise from the drying of the material , in conjunction with the building of a higher chimney stalk ; or , otherwise , to remove daily all the residue from the digesters and filter presses to some other locality for drying purposes , where this process may be accomplished without creating a nuisance to residenters in its neighbourhood .Whether this can be insisted upon by the Local Authority , under the Public Health Act , is a question for the consideration of the Town - Clerk . |

| source.excerpts.44.value | In the Spring of 1910 , complaint regarding this work had been frequent , and there is little doubt that whatever portion of the smells at that time arose from trade processes , it was greatly accentuated by the presence of a large quantity of unwhole - some box meat which was then being stored without any satisfactory provision for dealing with the effluvia therefrom .The removal of this had been accomplished before my report of July was submitted , but I then expressed the opinion that the apparatus for drying the solid residue of the digesters seemed to me to be defective , and a possible source of much smell .The statutory officers under the Public Health Act had been instructed to report on the removal of this box meat , and in consequence of this , and of the instruction of the Board to submit the present report , special watches were instituted , and as a result of this and of personal inspection on several occasions , a conjoint report by the officers in question was submitted to the Committee on Health , on December 13 , 1910 . |

| source.excerpts.45.value | Apart from complaint at Millerston , and along the line of the sewer in Cumber - nauld Road , before it reaches the boundary of Glasgow , the distribution of the smells thereafter is confined to that portion of the road which forms the boundary to the north - east of Kennyhill Goods Station .In this section of the sewer there are about one dozen grated manholes , and smells have been detected issuing from seven of them .Further along the sewer , where it makes an angle in unbuilt ground to the east of the boundary , there are two manholes , and by repeated inspection similar smells have also been detected escaping therefrom , but beyond this there is no complaint , and the most likely explanation is that the volume of added sewage ultimately dilutes the distillery effluent to a degree which renders it inoffensive . |

| source.excerpts.87.value | We have no doubt , therefore , that the complaints we have received of offensive odours in Ardmore Street , Culloden Street , and Coventry Drive have a similar origin , and are not connected with the Tallow Melting Works in question , the effluents from which , as will be observed from the plan , flow in an opposite direction , through the 4 feet barrel sewer which discharges into the Alexandra Parade sewer at Armadale Street â   a considerable distance to the west .On visiting the works themselves we at once felt the effluvium whenever we entered the yard , as it seems to cling to the walls , and is never absent inside a work of this description .On making careful enquiry into the various processes , the following report may be taken to fairly represent what goes on : â   The first part of the process from which effluvia are likely to arise is during the discharge of the solid residue from the steam digesters , which are three in number . |

| source.excerpts.88.value | The nuisance arising from these smells would appear to have been brought to the notice of the Board in one complaint ( see Boardâ   s letter to Reporter of June 30 , 1910 ) .The smells , however , are believed to be quite separate in their origins , although their areas of distribution are sufficiently close to lead to their being regarded as common to one district in the north - east of the City .Those which are peculiar to the Cumbernauld Road area of complaint are believed to emanate from sewer manholes , while those pervading the Coventry Drive area are regarded by many persons resident in the neighbourhood as originating in the Tallow Melting Works of Cooper & M ' Donald , which is situated in their midst . |

| source.excerpts.93.value | Further , on removal from the presses the residue is roughly broken up with a shovel , and placed in a drying stove , through which air is drawn by an electric fan , and passed into a chamber in front of and below the furnace bars of the steam boiler .These all represent recognised methods of dealing with material of this sort , but they nevertheless describe processes which are unavoidably associated with the development of smells , and in my opinion relief from the smells will only be accom - plished by altering the whole process of drying , and possibly also by adding to the height of the chimney .As long as the furnaces are being briskly fired , effluvia from the drying stove will undoubtedly be destroyed , but as the demand for steam varies , so , it is to be feared , will the efficiency of the furnace as a destructor of effluvia . |
