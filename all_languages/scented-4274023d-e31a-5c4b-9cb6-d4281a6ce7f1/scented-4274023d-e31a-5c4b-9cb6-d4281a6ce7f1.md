| source.excerpts.1.value | In nine weeks we only called at two ports , Freetown on the west coast of Africa , and Durban on the east coast .Freetown has the usual strong combination smell of nigger , cinnamon , and decaying vegetation , in an atmosphere of heavy steam , that characterizes all tropical towns inhabited by our " black brother ." We were told that this place had but a few years ago the pleasant subtitle of " The White Man ' s Grave . |

This night the wind was strong , and the smell of warm blood mingled with the phosphorous odor of high explosive , and there was that other sweet - sticky - sickly smell that is the strongest scent of a recent battle - field .It was a vile , unwholesome job , and we were glad that our time was limited to three - quarters of an hour , when our artillery would re - open fire . |

| source.excerpts.3.value | Its pews were thick with dust , the images were chipped and broken , some saints were minus nose or arm , the vestments in the open cupboard were moth - eaten and tawdry , dried flowers lay on tombs of the village great ; but its atmosphere was one of peace , and it was not difficult to realize that many had carried therein their burden of grief and unrest and left it behind them , soothed on the bosom of Mother Church , like a fretting child .But it is not the business of soldiers to sleep , and suddenly came the awakening with the sound of the hundreds of motor - buses that were to carry us into the noise and devastation of hell ! We marched up to the rim of the village , and amid the smell of gasolene , the tooting of the horns , and the roar of the engines we boarded these , thirty to a bus , and rumbled on toward the greatest noise and flame and fire that has ever torn the atmosphere asunder , outdoing any earthquake , thunderstorm , or tornado that nature has ever visited upon humanity .On this journey we saw more of the tremendous organization needed to equip and feed an army than we had been able to visualize before . |

| source.excerpts.4.value | The English port we entered was shrouded in fog , and wharf buildings never at any time look inviting , but we could nevertheless understand the excitement of our English companions , for it was Home to them , and to us " dear old England , " the brave heart of the freest empire this earth has seen , and after all where is the Britisher who does not thrill with pride at landing on the soil of those little islands which have produced a race so great , and foot for foot of soil there is no land on the earth that has produced so much wealth .We could smile with appreciation and not much surprise at the Tommy who remarked ; " Say , Bill , don ' t the gas - works smell lovely ! " CHAPTER XXVIII IN LONDON By hospital - train , the most comfortable ever devised , did we run into Waterloo Station - - doors were opened , and men in gorgeous uniforms - - much gold braid and silver buttons - - came aboard .We thought that they were admirals and field - marshals at the very least , but it turned out they were only members of the Volunteer Ambulance Corps , men unfit for military service , who had provided their own cars and received not a penny of pay . |

| source.excerpts.5.value | In camp the boys stroll over to their tents , exchanging an occasional word with pals , but for the most part silent , and turn in , tired also , and a little thoughtful .In an hour all the stars shine brightly from the velvety , blue - black sky , the soft - scented air wafts in through open tent - flaps , lights are out , and all is quiet in the camp , except for the periodical changing of pickets and the occasional roar of a passing train in the distance .CHAPTER VI MANY WEEKS AT SEA A troop - ship has no longer a name , but although the ship we boarded at Port Melbourne docks was designated by the number A 14 , it was not hard to discover that we were on a well - known ocean - liner , for on life - buoys and wheelhouse the paint was not so thick that inquisitiveness could not see the name that in pre - war days the Aberdeen line proudly advertised as one of their most comfortable passenger - carrying ships . |

| source.excerpts.6.value | I saw a pretty ugly - looking crowd dispersed with a characteristic Australian weapon .Firing over their heads had no effect , nor threats of a bayonet charge , but when two Australian bushmen began plying stockwhips , those niggers made themselves scarcer than mice on the smell of a cat .As a good manipulator of the stockwhip can pull the cork from a bottle , maybe these plotters were afraid of having their guilty secrets picked from them . |

| source.excerpts.7.value | It is a wonder those sailors didn ' t cut our hair when we were asleep to stuff their pillows - - they certainly skinned us as close as they could .PART II EGYPT CHAPTER VII THE LAND OF SAND AND SWEAT How we hated Egypt before we left it ! It may be a land of fascination to the tourist who drives about in gharris to view its wonders and stays at a European hotel , but to be there as a soldier , to lie in its vile sand , to swallow its conglomerated stinks , to rub the filth off the seats in the third - class train - carriages , to have under your eyes continually the animated lump of muck that the " Gyppo " is , to have your ears filled continually with the vile expressions that the Egyptian conceives as wit , is an experience that makes one so disgusted that few Australians that were there will ever want to see the rotten country again .At first , however , all was novelty , and we were like children on a picnic as we marched from the wharf into the third - class carriages of the Egyptian state railways waiting for us just outside the gates . |

| source.excerpts.8.value | Nipper objected to a certain remark of the slacker in the car , and without joining in the conversation leaped into the car and dragged out his overcoat into the mud , not relinquishing it until it was well soaked .On board the troop - ship Nipper pined for the smell of the gum leaves , and it was the only time when we lost patience with him , for every night he would stand in the bow and howl .The smells of Egypt disgusted Nipper , remembering the scents of the Australian bush . |

| source.excerpts.9.value | But lengthen that journey by three and you have had enough sea travel for a lifetime .Well , we left England and for an eternity sailed south , seeing land only on one day and smelling it for a week .Then we clung to the end of Africa for seven days and then sailed east for a decade till Australia got in our way , and as it could not be passed without a long detour , we were deposited on its soil . |

| source.excerpts.11.value | It is not generally a wise plan to occupy the old German trench , as he has the range of it very accurately , and anyway it is in most cases so badly battered about after our artillery has done with it as not to be at all superior as a residence to the shell - holes in front of it , and it is mostly full of dead Germans which are unearthed by the shells as often as we bury them .God knows the smell of a live German is not a pleasant thing to live near , but as for dead ones ! .. |

| source.excerpts.12.value | They are unsociable brutes and ought to be segregated , anyway .No wonder every high - bred horse is terrified at the smell of a camel ; the first time you meet one it is like a blow in the face and remains a weight on your mind until the camel is a long way to leeward .They had a special objection to carrying fresh water , and nearly always bolted when they discovered it was " Adam ' s ale " that was swishing about on the outside of their hump . |

| source.excerpts.13.value | Another day we sighted a steamer hull down , evidently water - logged , and we were going to her assistance when a cruiser came along and told us to go about our business and get out of harm ' s way as quickly as we could .This cruiser was just a little whiff of " scented gum " ; and Australian air to us , for she was one of the best known of the Australian squadron .There is a lonely island in the mid - Indian Ocean which is the only land for thousands of miles , and it is an unwritten law of the sea that every ship going that way should steam round it and watch carefully for signal - fires or signs of human occupation , for it is the place that shipwrecked sailors make for , and therefore there have been placed on the island several casks of fresh water and a supply of flour , and goats have been turned loose until they now overrun it . |

| source.excerpts.14.value | Lying in those cots , one had but to gaze ceilingward , and forget that one was in a hospital .It required little imagination to people the rooms with the same splendor and fashion that fills Monte Carlo , and maybe , had the war not come and the gambling license been granted , all this barbaric splendor would have been perfumed with the scents of " attar of roses " and " lily - of - the - valley " instead of " iodoform " and " carbolic ." Another hospital was in Luna Park , which had been built to cater to the amusement of thousands of joy - seekers , but the only joy there now was in relief from pain . |

| source.excerpts.15.value | We let them pass us and get well away from their trenches , then silently , like hunters stalking wild beasts , we followed them .When we were close enough to be almost overpowered by the smell of sauerkraut and sausage mingling with stale sweat , my voice rapped out , though muffled by the thick air : " Hands up ! " There was no hesitation in obeying , although there were eight of them and only six of us .We pointed out the direction for them to go , and reminded them with our boots that there was no time to waste . |

| source.excerpts.16.value | Every large city has its sore , but Cairo has an ulcer .This vile spot made the clean lads from the wind - swept plains and scented bush of Australia absolutely sick .The Australian is a practical idealist , and for him to see dirt is to want to remove it . |

| source.excerpts.17.value | It was some job getting into those carriages .Ordinarily white people travelled first - class , but we were troops , and it was like pushing against a wall to pass the smell that came from the doors of these carriages that had been the preserves of the unwashed nigger of varied age and sex for the Lord knows how many years .We left the ship with twenty - four hours ' provisions , which were all consumed on that train . |
