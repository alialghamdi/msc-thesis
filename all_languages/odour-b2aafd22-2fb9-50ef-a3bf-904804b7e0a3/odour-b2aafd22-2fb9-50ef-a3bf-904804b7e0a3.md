| source.excerpts.31.value | Thus the senses of smell and taste have pleasures of their own like the senses of sight and hearing , and pleasures neither less poignant nor very much less capable of fine graduation and discrimination than those .Why , then , are the experiences of these senses not called beautiful ? and why is the title of fine art not claimed , or only claimed in jest , for any skill in arranging and combining them 1 Why are there no arts of savours and perfumes corresponding in rank to the arts of forms , colours , and sounds ? An answer commonly given is that sight and hearing are intellectual and therefore higher senses , that through them we have our avenues to all know ledge and all ideas of things outside us ; while taste and smell are unintellectual and therefore lower senses , through which few such impressions find their way to us as help to build up our knowledge and our ideas .To this it may be replied that music , in its perfect or developed state , the ac complished fine art , that is , of sounds , deals precisely with those modes and relations of sound , pure sound as apart from words , which least convey knowledge or definite ideas , and can so far at least be called intellectual . |
